## Notebook

Contains the code relating to the model loading e additional code for inferences regarding variables to be given as input to the inference methods for each model and each type of in-context learning.

## Output

Contains the output of the in-context learning inference on test set depending on the samples: 

* zero_shot on five sample, 
* zero_shot on ten sample,
* zero_shot on all sample,
* one_shot on five sample, 
* one_shot on ten sample,
* one_shot on all sample,
* two_shot on five sample, 
* two_shot on ten sample,
* two_shot on all sample.

## Inferenza_globale.py

Contains the code relating to the calculation of in-context learning inferences: zero-shot, one-shot, two-shot.
