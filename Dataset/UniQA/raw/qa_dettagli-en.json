They combine the technical skills related to the production and consumption of food and wine, to their marketing and to their media repercussions, with the notions and sensibilities of socio-semiotics, cultural geography, aesthetics enabling them to give back to the food phenomenon the cultural and symbolic depth characterising it, being able therefore to operate with awareness and effectiveness, in the promotion of food and wine products in different socio-cultural contexts as well as in food education or in the production of different text types, from food and wine journalism to guides, from social media to television broadcasts, etc.\nThe educational programme is divided into different areas of knowledge:\n- Semiotic-communicative area, with teachings such as Food and Wine Languages and Food Experience, Media and food and wine, Brand Semiotics, Design and food packaging, Semiotics of consumption spaces, Theory and techniques of seriality.\n- Historical, anthropological, geographical, and social area, with the teachings: Ethnogastronomy, History of Food, Food Consumption Sociology.\n- Area of Food Sciences and Nutrition, with the teachings: Mediterranean Food Systems and Supply Chains, Nutrition and Health, Sensory Analysis and Wine Production.\n- Legal area, with the teaching: Agri-Food Law.\n- Economic-Tourism and Marketing area, with teaching such as Food and Wine Marketing and Tourism, Cultural and Food and Wine Heritage Management.\n- Creativity and design area, with the teachings: Communication Campaign Workshop, Exhibit Design Workshop, Food Writing Workshop.\nDuring the first course year, students acquire the skills necessary to understand the communicative and cultural aspects characterizing food and wine systems, the history of food and the social dimension associated with food consumption. The basis for understanding the mechanisms of taste experience is also provided. Furthermore, through the laboratories, students will acquire practical skills related to the creation of communication campaigns, to the writing of different text types, and to the design of consumption spaces. An elective course will enable them to decide to personalise their own path, deepening different aspects of the food phenomenon, from the more technical ones such as the nutritional aspects or the production dynamics in the wine sector, to the more communicative ones related to the construction and management of the brand, to the packaging design, to the analysis of the consumption spaces, up to the legal or managerial aspects.\nIn the second year, skills and tools will be provided to analyse the media impact of food and wine, the aesthetic peculiarities of food taste as well as tasting techniques. These skills will be complemented by those related to food and wine marketing and to the tourism dynamics caused by food and wine, as well as to the production aspects and the link they have with quality certifications and therefore with their economic repercussions. Through the elective activities students will be able to complete their own path in the direction they wish. Finally, through the internship, students will be able to put into practice what they have learned and eventually develop specific thesis projects together with companies.\nThe credits in subjects useful for entering the job market will be provided through a program of seminars with companies and professionals operating in various fields: from catering to journalism, from education to marketing.\n"

To be more concrete, graduates of this course should be able to: a) choose the most appropriate legal form for starting a business; apply for the necessary administrative permissions/concessions; register the activity in the competent offices; get a VAT number; hire their own employees, conclude contracts for the supply of goods and services, conclude contracts for the sale of goods and services, etc .; b) plan their activities from an economic-financial point of view; determine the extent of the necessary capital; choose the best ratio between equity capital and borrowed capital; enable a proper system of solvency and cost controls; change in time their entrepreneurial formula; rearrange the production factors in response to changing market needs; c) use technology, especially information technology, as a productive factor; use technology for the supply of raw materials and/or for the sale and distribution of their products and/or services (e-procurement, e-commerce, etc.); assess whether and to what extent it is convenient to do research and development within the company and beyond which point would not be better to conclude synergies with universities or other research centres according to the model of so-called open innovations.\nThe program includes:\n-\tthe teaching of private law, constitutional law, business economics, corporate accounting and management of the so-called open innovation\n-\tthe teaching of the main professional subjects (commercial law, tax law, labour law, administrative law, private international law, comparative law and techniques and simulation of trading).\n-\tthe teaching of subjects aimed at providing the necessary historical and ethical-philosophical references.\n-\tan offer of advanced subjects, as well as of related and integrative subjects available in other University courses.\nThe teachings will be distributed in the three years according to an educational process aiming at facilitating a critical and multidisciplinary learning, during which students will be called to face from the beginning the \"enterprise\" as a whole, under a pedagogical paradigm aiming at overcoming certain excesses in the partitioning of those subjects which, form various perspectives, deal with business. This therefore explains why the course instead of following a traditional path (first year-core subjects, second year-class-specific subjects and third year-specialist subjects), has a circular outline, within which the same problem will be examined from different perspectives.\nIn addition, the provision of tutorials, simulations in the classroom and the internship provide the student with an approach as close as possible to the work environment.\n"

Their functions are also used in the preparation of town planning regulations and in the design of new landfills and/or waste disposal plants.\nSkills:\nThe required skills of graduates in the Geological Science and Technology class have changed hand in hand with the changed socio-economic structure both in Italy and in international contexts at large. The progressive transfer of interest from occupational activities and perspectives aimed at a total and sometimes indiscriminate use of the territory is known, in which the figure of the professional geologist acted as a support for example to that of the engineers, to activities aimed mainly at a more reasoned use of land resources. Activities were thus developed to find renewable energy resources (e.g. geothermal energy), enhancement of cultural and environmental heritage and above all the assessment of geological risks, in continental and marine environments.\nProfessional opportunities:\nGeologists can work as freelance professionals, after passing the national professional qualification exam, also working in private engineering and geotechnical offices and laboratories. They may also find employment in public bodies with technical branches for the planning for the protection and safeguard of the landscape heritage as well as in bodies for the protection of Cultural Heritage. They can also find professional opportunities in public institutions for seismic, volcanic and hydrogeological surveillance. They may work as geologists at hydrocarbon research companies, as well as in companies for the extraction (quarries or mines) of material useful in civil engineering.\nIn addition, geologists may find employment in public and/or private companies dealing with landfill monitoring, as well as for the remediation of contaminated sites.\n"

The lines of action of these teachings include urban, general and social science issues, related to the typical procedures and techniques of regional and urban planning. Along with the theoretical teachings are developed laboratories pursuing experimental actions, which train students also through experimental practice and simulation of planning processes. These laboratories are usually related to topics concerning the city, the territory and the environment. In these courses students see the  application of the experimental reasons of their future profession, which will be further explored through practical activities, during the internships in the third year of the course.\nThe three-year Degree in Urban Planning and City Sciences trains experts in the analysis, research and representations related to the city, the anthropized or natural territory, the environment and the landscape.\nTheir professional expertise is at the basis of the process of drawing up urban, territorial, environmental and sector plans prepared by the Public Administrations (Regions, Municipalities, Local Authorities) or by Agencies, Organizations and private companies.\nThe professional skills of graduates in Urban Planning and City Sciences enable them to understand and interpret the processes of historical transformation of the territory and of the cities, peculiar skills necessary for the preparation of analyses aiming at the knowledge of the territorial resources and their state of conservation, heritage building (both historical and contemporary) and of complex systems such as landscape and environmental ones.\nGraduates in Urban Planning and City Sciences also possess the social, political and economic skills interacting with the structure of the city and the territory, as well as the ability to use the tools for strategic environmental assessment (VAS) and for the representation and management of geographic information (Geographic Information System),considered  today among the professional skills most requested by the Public Administrations and in all cases of drafting of complex territorial projects.\nThe Degree Course in Urban Planning and City Sciences, in short, has the following objectives:\na) education of experts capable of:\na1) coping with the use of new technologies (CAD and GIS) for the analysis, description, interpretation and evaluation of territorial and environmental transformations;\na2) using in their professional practice the principles and techniques aiming at the knowledge of the elements for the recovery of historical centres and for urban and territorial redevelopment;\na3) using in their professional practice the principles and techniques aiming at the knowledge of the elements for the protection and enhancement of cultural and environmental heritage both concentrated and widespread in the territory;\nb) cooperating with the public administration in the control, management and evaluation of the transformation processes of the city and the territory and in the forecast/implementation of complex programs, in particular with respect to the indications and tools offered by the Union European and with to the use of the economic resources of the community and to the policies of development of the European territory.\nTraining in the field of spatial planning and urban planning must take into account the major changes (from the escalation of global environmental issues to the globalization of economic and cultural dynamics, to the new forms of conflict) that run through the planning and that are putting a strain on ethical foundations, disciplinary statutes, theoretical and methodological systems of planning itself. These changes do not only affect the labour market and the emergence of new professional profiles, but also the questions, citizenship rights and social needs to which the planning \"culture\" must know how to respond.\n"

The proposed educational process aims at fostering the full integration between knowledge and skills in the field of landscape design and management at different scales, the acquisition of the ability to collaborate with other professionals in the fields of architecture, engineering and natural, agronomic and forestry sciences, of other social sciences and humanities, in a constant adjustment among consolidated skills and abilities. The specific objectives integrate design skills with the attention, extended to the whole educational process, towards themes such as sustainability, sharing and development of processes to increase social awareness, through continuous integration, and an adequate articulation of teachings in thematic design studios, mixing the most purely technical-scientific cultural areas with humanistic disciplines and which refer to the cultural foundations of the landscape.\nThe educational programme is divided into three phases, articulated in four semesters. The first phase is characterised by a process of homogenization of the cultural groundings of incoming students - often very different from each other - through the delivery, in the first semester, of teachings specifically targeted to the prevailing cultural profiles of the students, specifically the 1st cycle degree classes L-17, L-21, L-23 and L-25, in a way to promote the formation of a common knowledge base both under the cultural profile and under the perspective of the technical lexicon. The second phase, coinciding with the second and third semester, is mainly dedicated to train students for design, through four interdisciplinary design studios and some mono-disciplinary teachings integrating them. The studios, which are the cornerstone of the training of landscaper students, are driven by the principles of sustainability, environmental compatibility of the interventions, topicality of the cultural and design proposal, contribution to the redevelopment and prevention of all forms of risk: the landscape design for urban areas, the conservation and restoration of landscape heritage, the strategic project and landscape plan tools for large areas, the relations between urban and extra-urban environment. The third phase completes the course through a unitary start-up path to the labour market that includes adequate space for internship activities, together with any other complementary training activities, at companies and public institutions and which are part of a path leading to the development of the degree thesis project as the final stage of the training course.\n"

        "context": [
            "2250_dettagli_en.txt"
        ],
        "answer": "Specific educational objectives\nIn the context of global interdependence characterising our world, the imbalances, and inequalities of a cultural, political, social and economic nature among the different regions of the planet are worsening. At the same time, the adherence to religious beliefs, even if not necessarily to the relevant institutions, is increasing, in contrast with the narrative of an increasingly secularized world. Starting from this assumption, the Degree Course aims at providing its students the keys to understanding current religious phenomena through the analysis of the methodologies, history, hermeneutics and cultural representations of the three great monotheistic religions. In support of this objective, the understanding of historical-religious phenomena and cultural transformations will make use of historical investigation tools to grasp the salient aspects of the evolution of religious history, with particular reference to the Mediterranean and near-eastern area, from ancient times to date.\nThe city of Palermo, repeatedly invoked as the \"capital of the Mediterranean\" and of an island which is the crossroads of religions and cultures, now in conflict, now peacefully living together, is very well suited as the ideal seat of the Course. The partners of the Degree Course place it as an indispensable condition that its general structure respects a balance between the disciplines dedicated to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, leaving students the freedom to balance the space dedicated to one or another. In the current state of the skills and availability of resources provided by the partners in the training offer, a significant expansion of the latter to other religions is impracticable, however the organizing committee, which has already obtained the availability of the others two partners of the Course (the Pontifical Theological Faculty of Sicily-FATESI and the John XXII I-FSCIRE Foundation for Religious Sciences), hopes that this can happen in the future.\nThe structure of the Course includes, in the first year, some mandatory teachings on the sources, methods and foundations of the history of religions at large, of the three monotheistic religions, and of culture, and on the history of Christian churches and confessions on a global level. These teachings are then accompanied by three other restricted groups of optional teachings concerning the hermeneutics of Christian, Jewish and Islamic sacred texts, and historical, historical-religious, geopolitical and anthropological studies related to religious phenomena, aiming to enable students to the decoding, too often trivially simplified or ignored, of the incidence of religious adhesion of individuals and groups in the current cultural, social, political and economic processes. The first year ends with a seminar transversal to all disciplines, aiming at deepening specific theme, distinct from year to year, related to the modalities of dialogue between religions, but also highlighting the potential obstacles to its development (activity F), and a language laboratory aimed at achieving level B2 (to choose from English, French, German, and Spanish), particularly focused on disciplinary lexicons. In the second year, a first group of optional teachings is provided, concerning the epistemological-doctrinal elaboration in the philosophical and theological field, both in its current results and in its historical evolution. A second group of optional disciplines is related to the literary and artistic representations, as well as the ethical codifications, shaped by religious systems. This last group is also integrated by three teachings, broadening the educational horizon to the religions of the Mediterranean, to those of India, as well as to the important theme of diasporas and religious minorities. The educational programme is completed by the elective teachings, with the possibility of drawing on a group of recommended subjects, useful for integrating the knowledge already acquired with specific historical, legal and pedagogical insights (in the latter case also due to the achievement of part of the 24 CFU required for access to competitions for teaching in the school). The teachings included in this last list in the form of free assignment in agreement (AFGC) with FSCIRE will be activated only in the presence of a minimum number of interested students, which will be established by the Course Regulations. The internship at organizations active in inter-religious volunteering, or at cultural institutions directly linked to the conservation/communication of the heritage of the sacred (archives, libraries, museums, radio or television broadcasters) then aims to better define the practical skills necessary in the labour market. Finally, particular attention is given to the final examination, considered as an important step of the education to research in the field of religious studies.\n"

        "answer": "Specific objectives: The interclass degree in Musicology and Performance Studies provides in-depth historical and theoretical knowledge of music, theatre, cinema, of their mutual relationships and of the ways they are disseminated. It also provides adequate competence in the literary, philosophical, economic subjects, completing the preparation of students in an interdisciplinary perspective. \nThe course trains students able to carry out independently original research and professional activities in the fields of disciplines characterizing the two degree classes, from teaching to media stusied, to cultural organisation and management. \nStudents will deepen the competences acquired, with respect to musicology, ethnomusicology, theatre, performing arts, cinema and audio-visual media. They will also acquire theoretical and practical advanced skills on the ways and forms of traditional and high-tech digital live performing arts (music and theatre) such as multimedia installations and technological theatre, as well as similar experience about the ways and forms of audio-visual, film, television and multimedia online and off-line products. \nThey will also acquire management skills\nThe educational programme provides students of both curricula with the knowledge required for the two degree classes (interclass), however the second year focuses specifically on one of the two learning areas (Musicology / Entertainment).\nTo deepen the theoretical-practical knowledge in the field of class-specific subjects, the course combines musicological disciplines of common interest to the two degree classes (L-ART / 07: History and didactics of musical theater and Poetry and image), to teachings related to the History of theater and cinema (L-ART / 05 and L-ART / 06: Theories and techniques of acting, Practices of cinematographic and audiovisual direction, Theories of cinema).\nThere is also a teaching related to research methodology.\nAmong the class specific subjects in  the literary field, the field of English literature and theater has been privileged (L-LIN/10), not only for the value that the English theatrical tradition has in the history of European civilization, but also for the possibility of dealing with contemporary rewrites of this tradition in various English-speaking countries.\nAs for related disciplines, the teaching of Organization and production of the show (SECS-P/10), provides the necessary skills to fit into this professional field, while the teaching of the sector ICAR/14 (for the LM- class 65) is intended for theoretical reflection on space in cinema and theater. In the Musicology curriculum, the teaching of Musical Pedagogy (M-PED/01) and Anthropology of Music (L-ART/08) reinforce the pedagogical and anthropological knowledge already acquired in the 1st cycle course, in line with the provisions of the Ministerial Decree 616/2010 on access to teaching competition classes.\nA curricular internship is foreseen, useful for expanding technical and practical skills. The internship activities are in fact an important element of contact with the labour market and the professions related to perfroming arts.\nThe course also provides additional language skills. \nThe above objectives are achieved through: \n-the use of lectures and seminars and the subsequent verification of skills acquired both in class and during individual study through written and/or oral examinations; \n- the possible preparation of written texts or literature searches; - \n- the participation in workshops and internships; \n- the preparation of a written final paper, under the guidance of a supervising professorm considered an essential moment of personal elaboration of the acquired knowledge and methodologies.\n"

        "answer": "The STEDIS course aims at deeply investigate the cultural, scientific and professional fields related to the safeguarding, protection and sustainable management of the soil as a complex, dynamic, multi-phase and multi-elemental ecosystem that exchanges energy and materials with the external environment.\nThe Course provides the understanding of the interactions between the different phases (solid, liquid and gaseous) of the soil, the study of the chemical elements present and their relationships with the vegetal component and the lower atmosphere. In particular, the study of the relationships governs the formation of outflows, erosion processes at different spatial scales and the consequent degradation processes (sedimentation, sodicization, salinization, eutrophication of water bodies, loss of fertility, diffuse pollution of agricultural origin).\nThe scientific fields characterizing the LM-69 STEDIS educational project refer to the disciplines of fertility and soil conservation, production, agricultural engineering, as well as the economic-management area. Furthermore, the project is completed with the acquisition of topics and knowledge in related fields such as applied botany, forestry, geomorphology, legislation and environmental assessment.\nThe skills that students can acquire are based on the acquisition of the most innovative technical-scientific knowledge of the disciplines of surveying and territorial information systems, applied botany, soil conservation and protection, hydrology, and the physical quality of soils. These skills are completed by the topics of geomorphological hazards, environmental legislation and related evaluation techniques, soil microbiology, agronomic techniques, and the choice of wood species for soil conservation as well as for forest fire prevention and protection. The complex of these disciplines, which underlie the implementation of soil defence, conservation and sustainable management techniques, can be completed with elective teachings, enriching skills and abilities in the fields of biotechnics of plant species and naturalistic engineering also with reference to the degradation of wooden materials, bioindicators of soil quality and the recovery of degraded areas.\nAll the teachings provide the achievement of specific skills, through laboratory and field exercise (from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 3. Students acquire skills related to the use of survey techniques and information systems for the representation of the territory, the identification and survey of vegetation typologies, the interpretation of the results of the analyses on a soil sample and the relative certification, the use of field and laboratory for the hydrological characterization of soils, the application of soil survey methodologies and land evaluation systems, the treatment and microbiological analysis of soil samples, the use of models for estimating soil loss at different spatial scales, the recognition of rocks and field geomorphological survey techniques, the recognition of herbaceous and woody species for soil protection interventions, the drafting of exemplary cases of environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment.\nThe educational path includes 10 curricular teachings, with 50% integrated courses including a maximum of 2 modules. Each teaching includes lectures, with a student workload of 8 hours for each credit, and a variable number of credits (1-3) for exercises, laboratory activities and technical visits. For the latter activities, 1 credit corresponds to 12 hours of assisted teaching activity.\nThe training course is divided into three learning areas, called Territorial survey, Soil system analysis and monitoring and Design and management of soil defence and conservation interventions.\nThe teachings in the Territorial survey area are: Territorial Survey and Information Systems, Botany applied to soil protection and Soil surveying and evaluation.\nThe objective of Territorial Survey and Information Systems is to provide students with the methods to use and process satellite data, with the necessary skills and abilities to use GPS and terrestrial and aerial photogrammetry, as well as the knowledge and applications of SIT also in the organization of the work of a public or private body. \nBotany applied to soil protection will provide students with the knowledge and cognitive and methodological tools for the description and analysis of the physical, biological, and anthropic heterogeneity and complexity of the landscape, as well as for the management of ecosystems at different scales of reference. Finally, Soil Surveying and Evaluation aims at providing students with the methods and technologies necessary for the elaboration of soil and thematic maps and for their application to soil evaluation techniques.\nThe second learning area, Analysis and monitoring of the soil system includes the teachings: Soil conservation and protection, Hydrology and physical quality of soils with laboratory and Soil microbiology with laboratory.\nThe teaching Soil conservation and protection provides the theoretical foundations for an advanced knowledge of soil alteration processes as well as the advanced methodological technologies and tools to be adopted for soil conservation and protection.\nHydrology and physical quality of soils provides students with the specialized knowledge necessary for the sustainable management of agricultural soil with particular reference to the fundamental hydrological processes involving the transport of water and solutes in the rhizosphere, as well as with the techniques for measuring the physical and hydraulic characteristics of the soil with particular reference to the assessment of physical quality. The learning area is completed with the microbiological characterization of the soils aimed at monitoring the degradation processes and identifying intervention solutions.\nThe third learning area \"Design and management of soil defence and conservation interventions\" includes the teachings: Soil erosion and geomorphological hazard, Agronomic techniques for soil conservation, Fire prevention and protection techniques and Legislation and evaluation of interventions. \nThe Geomorphological Hazard module addresses the study of relief forms and the analysis of causes and factors underlying their genesis, development and evolution and integrates the teaching of Soil erosion and geomorphological hazard, which provides students with the essential elements for the interpretation and mathematical simulation of the erosive processes at different spatial scales (plot, slope of the catchment area), the evaluation of the production of sediments and the silting of reservoirs, the design and implementation of soil conservation and evaluation of the effects of fires on erosion processes. Soil conservation agronomic techniques provide students with the scientific and technical knowledge necessary to plan and organize crop sequences, technical itineraries and rational management models of Mediterranean herbaceous agrosystems for anti-erosion and soil protection purposes and will be supplemented by knowledge of the morpho - functional characteristics of trees, from the technical ones of arboreal systems in hills and mountains to the silvicultural management techniques of forest ecosystems effective for fire prevention and for the restoration of areas affected by fire.\nLastly, this area aims to provide students with a framework of environmental law with particular reference to the issues of soil protection and hydrogeological instability as well as with the regulatory and operational tools necessary to formulate judgments of economic and financial convenience relating to investment projects in both public and private fields.\nLearning is assessed through oral exams, with possible practical tests or discussion of papers, case studies and projects prepared during the lessons and exercises foreseen in the single course. The examination is always unique even in the case of an integrated course.\nThe two modules of the integrated course Territorial Survey and Information Systems belong to the same scientific sector and have common learning objectives, namely surveying with different techniques and managing spatial data, as well as similar evaluation methods, favouring the discussion of case studies and projects developed during the course.\nThe two modules of the integrated course Soil conservation and protection belong to the same scientific sector and are internally correlated by the study of soil alteration processes followed by protection techniques. The scientific language adopted and the teaching methods, in which the laboratory part is privileged, constitute the means to obtain full integration.\nIn the integrated course Legislation and evaluation of interventions. \nthe regulatory path in the field of environmental law and soil protection legislation is combined with the knowledge and skills in terms of evaluation of the consequent interventions for the prevention and mitigation of hydrogeological risk. The complementarity of the topics ensures the integration of knowledge and skills.\nThe integrated course Soil erosion and geomorphological hazard provides two different and complementary points of view (hydrological and geomorphological) of the erosion phenomena at the catchment area scale. The uniformity of the topics, the common scientific language and the typically applied teaching methodologies guarantee its complete integration.\nThe integrated course Fire prevention and protection techniques provides complementary knowledge on wood species and on the evaluation of the effects of fires on the soil-vegetation system. The two disciplinary sectors, belonging provide complementary skills with similar teaching methodologies.\n"

        "answer": "The growing complexity and dynamism of the competitive system in the era of globalization and digitization requires new professionalism able to address the problems in an interdisciplinary, flexible and innovative way. The figure of the Management Engineer responds to the needs of today's markets and this is the reason why the Management Engineer is increasingly appreciated and required both in the business world and in the public administration. \nThe Management Engineering deals with the solution of problems of technical, economic, managerial and organizational nature in the processes of production and consumption of goods and / or services using methods and solving skills characteristic of engineering. \nThe management engineer uses quantitative tools, decision-making supports and methodological rigor typical of engineering sciences in order to achieve optimizing solutions. The engineering vision and method applied to management and organizational problems allow the achievement of higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness of solutions, contribute to a better understanding of business phenomena, facilitate the identification and control of the most significant decision variables in the various business processes, lay the foundation for continuous improvement of business results on measurable parameters and, finally, lend themselves to the construction of well-structured relationships between the various functions of the company and between companies. \nWhile the preparation of a three-year management engineer is based on a solid basic training built on disciplines such as mathematics, physics, economics, statistics, operations research, computer science and design skills borrowed from the main engineering disciplines to which are added the characterizing disciplines, namely those relating to the fields of production technologies, industrial plants and economic-management engineering, the educational objective of the master's degree focuses more on the management training of the management engineer. \nIn particular, the learning objective of the master's degree program in management engineering, that is, to train an engineer-manager is translated into two specific sub-objectives: \nThe first specific learning objective is to transfer into the engineer student the so-called \"hard\" knowledge and skills of engineering-based management education, i.e., to provide in-depth, specialized, and scientific knowledge of managerial issues ranging from project management, innovation management, marketing, corporate finance, strategies, and supply chain management, as well as advanced technical skills for the \"design\" application of the acquired knowledge, for example, the skills of complex project management and quantitative and statistical analysis of business processes. Particular emphasis is also given to change management processes for the digitalization of the business and for the conversion towards the circular economy. \nTo achieve the first specific objective above, the training path is divided into 3 Learning Areas, which correspond to 3 blocks of disciplines:\n- The Disciplines that constitute the methodological basis of the second level Management Engineer, i.e. the in-depth study of statistical methods for management engineering, the methodologies of analysis and modeling of business processes, the methodologies for project management;\n- The Disciplines that constitute the managerial training of the second level Management Engineer or disciplines related to business functions such as marketing, finance, strategies, supply chain management and operations and cross-functional disciplines such as management of technological innovation and the design and management of customer satisfaction and human resources.\n- The in-depth disciplines on management issues, the so-called advanced management knowledge areas, i.e., disciplines related to the aspects and challenges of enterprise 4.0, environmental and social sustainability, digital transformation, market globalization, and organizational entrepreneurship.\nThe second specific learning objective is to increase in the student master management engineer transversal skills and abilities, the so-called \"soft skills\", extremely important for a complete management training. The ability to listen and communicate, teamwork, flexibility and leadership have always been an important requirement for those who aspire to become managers. Moreover, in our globalized and highly competitive economy, soft skills have become a fundamental competence. \nAdd to that the fact that digital transformation has made the role of soft skills even more relevant. Implementing the digital transformation projects of companies and productive sectors requires much more than technologies. The ability to relate to, negotiate, lead and sponsor change is even more crucial, because cultural transformation is the basis of digital transformation. \nTo address the second specific training objective, the teaching methodologies and content of individual lessons throughout the training are designed to stimulate:\n- The development of soft-skills related to team working, self-entrepreneurship, and leadership. All courses include teaching activities of a \"project\" nature and use typical MBA teaching methodologies such as group-project, case study, flipped-classroom, in-class discussion precisely to stimulate these soft-skills. \n- The development of soft-skills related to the aptitude for internationalization and global vision of markets. In addition, the fact that the course is delivered in English means that there are international students in the classroom and that an international atmosphere is created that can stimulate discussion and group projects towards a spirit of globalization.\n- The interest in knowledge and technical skills related to the management of digital transformation and technological change in all business and corporate processes. In particular, the interactive and project-based teaching methodologies, as well as some theoretical content of the teachings will be explicitly aimed at developing the need for digital skills called for by the Digital Europe Program 2021-2027. The goal is to improve Europe's competitiveness in the global digital economy and achieve technological sovereignty. This is only possible by implementing and developing new digital technologies in order to support the digital transformation that will ensure high quality public services for the benefit of citizens and businesses.\n"

        "answer": "PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES\nManagement engineer\nfunction in a work context:\nThe identikit of the Management Engineer can be effectively outlined through what reported by Corriere della Sera of 31 March 2006: \"An engineer-manager with high technical-scientific skills, able to manage financial and technological companies or to offer himself on the market as a high level corporate consultant. \"\nThere are therefore two main functions that the Management Engineer usually performs.\nThe first function is that of MANAGER who, in addition to possessing an in-depth, specialized knowledge of the so-called traditional managerial issues, ranging from marketing, corporate finance, strategies, supply chain management, has a strong scientific-engineering background as well as the skills to face managerial challenges using the analytical tools of project management, advanced statistics for big data, modelling and analysis of business processes.\nThe second function is that of STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL CHANGE CONSULTANT, supporting but also guiding work groups, with manifold and transversal skills, leading the company towards complex improvement, innovation, and transformation projects. They are multifaceted professionals, with solid technical and scientific groundings, providing them the aptitude for problem-solving and for the adoption of an engineering approach to business consulting. They are specialists in the challenges of contemporary business, industry 4.0, environmental and social sustainability, digital transformation, market globalization, organizational entrepreneurship.\nSkills:\nFor both functions, MANAGER and STRATEGIC-OPERATIONAL CONSULTANT, graduates in management engineering must possess both \u201chard\u201d, i.e., technical, and \u201csoft\u201d, i.e., transversal skills.\nIn particular, the \"hard\" skills consists of in-depth knowledge of the main business functions such as corporate finance, marketing, operations and supply chain management, innovation management, strategic management as well as the ability to know how to apply this knowledge for solving business problems through advanced \"business design\" techniques such as project management, business process modelling and analysis, and statistical analysis techniques of business phenomena.\nOn the contrary, the \"soft\" skills associated with the functions described above are: the ability to listen and communicate, to work in a team, flexibility and leadership skills, all essential to be able to cover both the role of manager and of consultant. The conversion of the traditional economy into a circular economy on the one hand, and the digital transformation and opening to global business on the other, have made the role of soft skills even more relevant. The implementation of business transformation projects requires much more than hard technologies and skills. The skills to relate, negotiate, lead and sponsor change are even more crucial, because cultural transformation is the basis of all others.\nProfessional opportunities:\nFor both the first and the second function of the management engineer, the placement in the job market of graduates in Management Engineering is wide-ranging.\nAs a MANAGER, the management engineer finds work in any industrial sector. From manufacturing companies, such as automotive and agri-food, to service companies, such as energy transport and distribution companies. From private companies to public administrations. As an example, in recent years management engineers have been hired by the majority of the largest Italian companies such as Eni, Enel, Poste Italiane, Unicredit, Ferrero, Telecom, Bank of Italy.\nSmall and medium-sized companies (public and private) also represent a large employment area for management engineers. For example, in recent years, the latter are increasingly finding employment with managerial roles in public and private healthcare companies, in innovative start-up companies, small bio-technological companies, etc.\nIn the role of STRATEGIC-OPERATIONAL CONSULTANT, the management engineer is highly sought after by the most important international consulting firms, such as Deloitte, PwC, KMPG, Ernst & Young, Accenture, MacKinsey, etc.\n"

        "answer": "The 2nd cycle Degree Course in Communication for cultural heritage aims at training professionals who, together with solid cultural groundings in the areas of humanistic knowledge related to text sciences and visual culture, possess the theoretical knowledge and technical skills of communication specialists and can conceive and coordinate high-profile projects in the field of valorisation and use of cultural heritage and contemporary visuality.\nOne of specific objectives of the course is the achievement of a mature and conscious understanding of image sciences, considered as an interplay among the analysis of the image, the social and individual gaze and the media supporting such images, in relation to the evolution of technologies and possible translations between different languages. Furthermore, the course aims at providing a mature and conscious understanding of literary knowledge in its various articulations (critical-literary, linguistic and cultural) and their connection with modern comparative studies, theory of literature, history of culture, semiotics, historical-philosophical disciplines and computer science applied to human sciences.\nFinally, the course aims at developing the aptitude for the analysis and design of solutions for the enhancement and use of cultural heritage, as well as for its greater understanding.\nDuring the course students can experiment, through various professional laboratories, the close observation of aspects, methods, and techniques crucial for their future professional role by acquiring, according to the educational planning or to their personal interests and skills, useful knowledge for entering the labour market. Internship activities and specific training activities will also be carried out aimed at projecting students towards their future professional role. Some credits will also be allocated to further elective training activities.\nThe educational programme is divided into different areas of knowledge:\n- semiotic-communication area, with teachings in cultural heritage semiotics, philosophy of experience, exhibition space semiotics.\n- anthropological and social area, with teachings related to cultural heritage anthropology, laboratory of computational social sciences, laboratory of polling theories and techniques.\n- legal area, with teachings such as Cultural Heritage regulations and History of political parties.\n- economic-tourism and marketing area, with teachings in Cultural Heritage and Food and Wine Management, Cultural industrial economics.\n- linguistic-literary and historical-artistic area, with teachings in Literary Communication, Visual Culture, Theory of Translation, Digital Philology, History of exhibitions and curation practice, Theory and history of art criticism, Theories of Interculturalism, Archaeology, Arab-Islamic cultural heritage, Theory of Seriality.\n- creative and planning area, providing teachings such as Immersive technologies for Cultural Heritage, Virtual Archaeology Workshop, Communication Campaign Creation Workshop, Exhibit Design Laboratory, Service Design Workshop, Cultural Heritage Digitization Workshop.\nDuring the first year, students acquire the skills necessary to understand the communicative and cultural aspects characterising material and immaterial cultural heritage. Alongside with semiotic and anthropologic knowledge related to the mechanisms constructing tradition and heritage, students will delve into the philosophical traits upon which their experience is based and explore literary heritage and the relevant communication.\nThrough the choice of two laboratories, in fact, students can acquire practical skills related to the creation of communication campaigns, market research and sociological analysis, design of services, digitization of cultural heritage and the construction of relevant virtual models, the design of exhibition spaces and installations. \nIn this way, in addition to personalizing their own training path, students characterize their professional profile in a specific way. Through three elective courses, they can decide to deepen different traits of the many issues related to different sectors of communication, from historical-artistic-archaeological to economic ones, as well as to political, philosophical, and cultural issues.\nThe second year provides skills and tools to manage the cultural heritage at large, to understand visual culture and the way in which recent technologies changed the use of various types of contents. Students will also be able to study the semiotic mechanisms through which exhibition areas build experiences, enhancing what they host. \nFinally, through the internship, students will be able to put into practice what they have learned and possibly develop specific thesis projects together with companies.\nThe credits in terms of competences related to the labour market will be provided through the creation of a program of seminars with companies and professionals operating in various fields.\n"

        "answer": "Graduates in Dietistics are, pursuant to law  no. 251, Article 3, paragraph 1 of August, 10, 2000, health professionals in the technical area carrying out, with professional autonomy, activities aimed at the prevention, care and safeguard of individual and collective health, applying the technical procedures needed for the implementation of diagnostic methods on biological materials or on the individual, or technical-assistance activities, in accordance with the provisions concerning the identification of the figures and the relevant professional profiles defined by the decree of the Minister of Health. Graduates in Dietistics have adequate competences in basic disciplines, enabling them to better understand the most important elements that underpin the evolutionary, adult and geriatric age pathologies, upon which they carry out their nutritional technical intervention. They must also be able to use at least one language of the European Union, besides Italian, in the specific area of competence and for exchanging general information. Within the profession of Dietician, graduates are healthcare professionals carrying out the duties assigned by the Decree of the Ministry of Health of 14 September 1994, no. 744, and subsequent modifications and additions; they are competent for all activities aiming at the proper application of nutrition, including the educational aspects and the collaboration in the implementation of food policies, in compliance with current legislation.\nIn particular, graduates in Dietistics, depending on their training paths, must reach the professional competence below described and specified. The achievement of professional skills is obtained through theoretical and practical training, also including the acquisition of behavioural skills and is achieved in the specific context of the profile so as to guarantee, at the end of the training course, full command of all the necessary skills and their immediate usability in the work environment. Particularly important, as an integral and qualifying part of vocational training, is the practical training and apprenticeship activity, carried out with the supervision and guidance of specially assigned professional tutors, coordinated by a teacher belonging to the highest professional training level and corresponding to the standards defined at European level, if existing.\nEducational programme\nThe training course is organized in six semesters and provides theoretical-practical teachings through lectures, exercises, educational workshops and seminars related to basic and clinical subjects; In particular, vocational training in the specific professional sector (MED/49) in the clinical field (nutritional activity for patient groups, inpatients, ambulatory discharge, specialist activity for pathologies, hospital hygiene and catering activities, assessment of body composition, measurement of energy expenditure), in the territory (maternal-infant care, home-based nutrition, etc.), in collective catering for school meals, rest homes, etc.\nAppropriate coordination actions during the course year (horizontal co-ordination) and across the different years of the course (vertical coordination) will be implemented, enabling the discussion and critical interaction about the project with the teachers of the various subjects. The course educational regulations define, in compliance with the regulatory limitations, the share of the total hours of study available to the student for personal study or other individual training activities.\nIn general, frontal teachings provide knowledge to address traineeship experiences. Core subjects are concentrated in the first year of the course and ensure the acquisition of the cognitive tools needed to develop the training programme that will continue in the following years through class-specific subjects. The latter, mostly present in the second and third course year, aim at providing the cultural elements to understand the various clinical areas in which nutritional intervention is carried out. Class-specific subjects are also aimed at the understanding and organization of dietary treatment and prevention through nutritional intervention, including the description and understanding of social and relational dynamics - with the patient as well as among the various professionals - contributing to the well-being of individual patients or specific population groups.\nThe latter will be the prevailing goal of the third year of the course. Related disciplines provide knowledge enriching the training on nutrition issues or on other issues necessary for professional work in the healthcare sector.\nMandatory professional internship is a qualifying element of the educational offer, because it allows students to deepen specific and professional skills, with responsibility and autonomy, in a different context than the classroom exercises.\nEducational objectives and professional training aim at achieving the highest quality through a continuous evolution of the training standard of students as future professionals. The internship will be evaluated through the following tools:\n-\tEvaluation forms, examining the general, behavioural and professional aspects in relation to the objectives, completed by the tutor and shared by the student;\n-\tThe training record as another reference to better understand the experience.\nAgreements with healthcare companies and collective catering companies guarantee an internship as adequate as possible to all real working facilities.\nAt the end of the three-year period, graduates in Dietistics will acquire the knowledge and technical skills enabling them to fit in in companies and institutions of the clinical area, the food industry and collective catering. Graduates will also acquire the learning skills necessary to undertake specialist studies.\n"

        "answer": "The 2nd cycle Degree course in Italian Studies aims at training graduates competent in Italian linguistics and literature according to both a synchronic and a diachronic approach. With this in mind, the teachings in the literary field range from humanistic-Renaissance literature to contemporary literature, with a focus on the methods of digital texts edition, which constitute an expansion in the direction of the acquisition of soft skills. Similarly, the teachings in the linguistic area are related both to the history of language and to dialectology, as well as to the sociolinguistic situation of contemporary Italy. Given that one of the main professional outlets is that of teaching, the course offers both language teaching methodology and literature teaching methodology, in which linguistic-literary issues are addressed according to the teaching methodology approach. The course also aims to increase the knowledge acquired by students (mostly from the  1st cycle Degree in Humanities) in the previous three years and to refine and develop their critical skills. Its primary objective is to provide for each disciplinary area the most up-to-date research tools enabling graduates to face the complexity of the current days. This objective will be achieved by deepening, in a specialist sense, the contents and knowledge already possessed as well as by perfecting the aptitude for analysis and research, also through a series of teachings completing the educational programme in the field of comparative literature, in the historical and philological fields, in linguistic theory and Latin literature. The skills acquired in the two-year period can be used in research, publishing, libraries, multifunctional centres, in organization and cultural activity in companies and public and private bodies, as well as in the context of creative activities used for social and advertising purposes. In relation to this objective, the course provides, as part of the characterizing activities, credits in the following fundamental scientific sectors: L-FIL-LET/10 Italian literature, L-FIL-LET/11 Literature contemporary Italian, L-FIL-LET/12 Italian linguistics, L-FIL-LET/09 Romance philology. In order to improve the competence of a foreign language, the course includes an English language laboratory in the first year. The course gives also the possibility of carrying out an internship at schools or other institutions, in order to provide a first contact with the world of work, particularly significant for a 2nd cycle degree.\nThe teachings consist of lectures and seminar activities during which, through intense oral and written activity, contents and methodologies will be deepened according to a full critical and expository development.\nThe examinations related to individual teachings may consist of both oral and written tests.\nThe methods of verifying the laboratory training activity are entrusted to in progress and final written and practical tests. The procedure for verifying the internship and traineeship activities consist of a final report signed by the student, by the degree program delegate, and by the head of the organization or institution and approved by the Board of the Degree Course.\nThe objective of the degree course is providing graduates with a preferential qualification within different career structures in the teaching of the humanities area. In conclusion, the Degree Course aims to make its graduates able to fit into professional areas relating to publishing, advertising, research, organization and management of cultural events.\n"

The course aims at providing graduates a cultural and professional profile clearly different from the one of computer science graduates, mainly for the interdisciplinary traits characterizing the most recent developments in artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence graduates will receive a solid training on the essential topics for artificial intelligence in the areas of mathematics, computer science, physics, and cognitive sciences. In particular, graduates will be able to use logical-mathematical tools with awareness, will possess a solid knowledge of the fundamental aspects of computer science and command of the topics, techniques and methodologies of artificial intelligence, including the extraction and representation of knowledge, automatic reasoning , machine learning, artificial vision, search and optimization algorithms, human-machine interaction, as well as application-based disciplines. Graduates in AI will also possess legal and ethical knowledge enabling them to make conscious use of the acquired knowledge and skills in decision-making and information processing processes. This knowledge is acquired through lectures and laboratory activities. The verification of the knowledge acquired in the various training activities is carried out in the most suitable forms for the specific types and characteristics of training activities. The verifications typically consist, for example, of written and/or oral exams, reports on the activities carried out and the knowledge acquired, intermediate tests, as well as the final test for obtaining the degree.\nThe laboratory and internship activities enable graduates to contribute, on the basis of constantly updated interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, to the design and implementation of innovative solutions based on AI techniques and models, both in the public and private sectors.\nThe educational activities aim both at understanding the fundamentals of AI and at experimenting its use in applications. The degree course is structured as follows:\n- the first two years consist of training activities dedicated to the founding nucleus of training in artificial intelligence and are essential for defining the graduate's interdisciplinary profile.\n- the third year is partially dedicated to the definition of specific methodological skills of artificial intelligence as well as to the use of artificial intelligence in application areas; in the third year, students can freely choose some courses according to their cultural interests and can complete the practical understanding of artificial intelligence, also in application areas, through laboratory activities or internships;\n- the training course is completed at the end of the third year with the final exam.\n"

They will also acquire theoretical and practical advanced skills on the ways and forms of traditional and high-tech digital live performing arts (music and theatre) such as multimedia installations and technological theatre, as well as similar experience about the ways and forms of audio-visual, film, television and multimedia online and off-line products. \nThey will also acquire management skills\nThe educational programme provides students of both curricula with the knowledge required for the two degree classes (interclass), however the second year focuses specifically on one of the two learning areas (Musicology / Entertainment).\nTo deepen the theoretical-practical knowledge in the field of class-specific subjects, the course combines musicological disciplines of common interest to the two degree classes (L-ART / 07: History and didactics of musical theater and Poetry and image), to teachings related to the History of theater and cinema (L-ART / 05 and L-ART / 06: Theories and techniques of acting, Practices of cinematographic and audiovisual direction, Theories of cinema).\nThere is also a teaching related to research methodology.\nAmong the class specific subjects in  the literary field, the field of English literature and theater has been privileged (L-LIN/10), not only for the value that the English theatrical tradition has in the history of European civilization, but also for the possibility of dealing with contemporary rewrites of this tradition in various English-speaking countries.\nAs for related disciplines, the teaching of Organization and production of the show (SECS-P/10), provides the necessary skills to fit into this professional field, while the teaching of the sector ICAR/14 (for the LM- class 65) is intended for theoretical reflection on space in cinema and theater. In the Musicology curriculum, the teaching of Musical Pedagogy (M-PED/01) and Anthropology of Music (L-ART/08) reinforce the pedagogical and anthropological knowledge already acquired in the 1st cycle course, in line with the provisions of the Ministerial Decree 616/2010 on access to teaching competition classes.\nA curricular internship is foreseen, useful for expanding technical and practical skills. The internship activities are in fact an important element of contact with the labour market and the professions related to perfroming arts.\nThe course also provides additional language skills. \nThe above objectives are achieved through: \n-the use of lectures and seminars and the subsequent verification of skills acquired both in class and during individual study through written and/or oral examinations; \n- the possible preparation of written texts or literature searches; - \n- the participation in workshops and internships; \n- the preparation of a written final paper, under the guidance of a supervising professorm considered an essential moment of personal elaboration of the acquired knowledge and methodologies.\n"

Students will therefore acquire an adequate amount of credits in three out of the five class-specific areas: Statistics, Applied Statistics, Demography; Business Economics, Applied Computer Mathematics;\n-\tAn adequate number of integrative and class related activities, divided into three groups. The first group consists of subjects integrating undergraduate competences, to  increase his/her knowledge in the fields of data management, sociology and epidemiology. The second and third groups contain scientific sectors which are included in the L-41 class specific ones (business administration and demography), which are useful for an in-depth study of economic and demographic issues. The Course also proposes and suggests a list of subjects, considered important, to help students to identify, in the field of \u201celective subjects\u201d, educational activities consistent with the educational programme. This list is updated each year, in accordance with the educational offer of the University of Palermo, and published on the Course website.\n-\tAn educational programme consisting not only of frontal teachings, but also integrated by practice laboratories, accompanying traditional teaching for the discussion of case studies and the investigation of economic-social issues. \nFor this reason, The educational offer provides four teachings related to computer issues, both at large and specifically statistical, in a way to provide graduates the ability to manage information, responding to the needs of the labour market. Laboratory activities aim at general and applied statistical applications, in a way to identify the limits and opportunities for statisticians in various application areas. In this way, the course aims at providing students with adequate critical capability which, based on solid methodological groundings, brings them to pay constant attention to the process of data production \u2013 conceptualization, definition and measurement \u2013 and to a critical use of theories and methods with respect to the type and meaning of available information;\n-\tPossibility of attending educational internships at private or public organization, (up to 6 credits).\n-\tpossibility of carrying out statistical consultancy activity (up to 3 credits - \"competences related to the labour market\") where a true statistical consultancy is simulated, under the guidance of teachers of the Course.

The syllabus, pursuant to the Interministerial Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022 of Law no. 163, provides that 10 credits are acquired by carrying out a practical-evaluation internship (TPV), consisting of contextualized and supervised practical activities, which involve direct observation and the execution of activities aimed at learning in situation and at the development of procedural and relational skills and abilities essential for the exercise of the professional activity.\nUpon completion of a semester of post-graduate professional internship, the degree course in 'Psychological Sciences and Techniques' allows access to the State Exam for section B of the Register of Psychologists, as well as to carry out professional activities at a technical-operational level.\nFor the Psychologist professional qualification and the enrolment in Section A of the Register, graduates must complete five-year studies. The 2nd cycle degree in the LM51 class enables graduates to practice the profession of psychologist (Interministerial Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022).\nThe educational objective of the course of study is achieved through a path providing the theoretical and methodological tools suitable for operating effectively in:\n- activities aimed at diagnosing, understanding and supporting individuals, families and groups, in order to promote their development and well-being and limit their discomfort;\n- analysis and development of communication processes;\n- prevention, evaluation and help and support interventions in psychological discomfort connected to problems of maladjustment and social deviance, psychological trauma, physical and mental illness, risk behaviours;\n- support interventions, with particular reference to residential and semi-residential facilities for minors, families, the elderly, drug addicts, psychiatric patients;\n- activities in public and private services (maternal and child services, training and educational services, socio-educational and scholastic institutions, housing communities and social services for youth problems), aimed at promoting development, knowledge and health;\n- assessment of the child and parental figures, in the context of psychological intervention in support of the mother-child and father-child relationship, as well as in situations of social and relational distress (e.g. maternity at risk, etc.), and in support of parenthood in critical moments of the life cycle;\n- empowerment programs and interventions for individuals and local communities;\n- activities in public and private services aimed at the optimal use of human resources in work and organizational contexts, through the identification and understanding of the psychological-social processes underlying performance, interpersonal relationships and the professional objectives pursued;\n- planning of interventions with public and private administrations and bodies for the promotion of well-being, organizational development and human and professional resources;\n- evaluation of local community profiles for the definition of the quality of life of neighbourhoods, towns, services and organization and the development of spontaneous, informal and formal associative networks in the area;\n- coexistence promotion programs, also with reference to multicultural and multi-ethnic processes, support interventions in the field of reception services, in critical emergencies and in cultural mediation.\nCourse outline\nThe first year provides an adequate basic knowledge of the foundations of psychology (general psychology, psychobiology and physiological psychology, developmental and educational psychology) and an interdisciplinary training in the fields of demo-ethnoanthropological disciplines and the history of philosophy. In addition, there are teachings aiming at consolidating and updating students' knowledge in computer science, quantitative analysis and English language. All courses develop basic theoretical-methodological aspects without neglecting the practical component.\nDuring the second year, the course becomes more operational. In addition to the mandatory activities related to dynamic and clinical psychology, developmental and educational psychology, psychometrics and social statistics, there are activities connected to the practical internal evaluation training related to the relational skills of the psychologist and the laboratories on the use of the tests.\nThe s third and final year provides teachings related to the areas of dynamic, clinical, industrial, and organization psychology as well as practical activities relating to TVP, practical evaluation training (both internal and external) and practical qualitative and quantitative research laboratories.\nFinally, the course provides elective teachings, which aim to guide students towards the specific 2nd cycle degrees.\nAll courses include exercises and laboratory activities to enable students to apply their knowledge and understanding in the various professional fields to which the degree refers.\nTPV's activities not only fit into the same framework but also favour the development of soft skills.\nAt the end of the course students will have acquired basic skills related to the various areas of Psychology as well as to research and data analysis in psychology.\n"

        "answer": "The specific educational objective characterising the Degree Course in Medicine and Surgery with technological orientation (MED-IT) is the training of a Medical Doctor with a wealth of expertise strongly enriched through the acquisition of typical engineering knowledge and methodological and technological skills. Graduates in MED-IT will thus be able to face, analyse and solve medical-biological problems with innovative methodologies.\nIn accordance with this objective, the MED-IT Degree Course is characterised by a balanced vertical and cross integration among:\na)\tBasic sciences, with a wide spectrum, including the knowledge of evolutionary biology, molecular biology, genetics, and biological complexity. This study aims at acquiring the knowledge of the structure and function of the human organism, in normal conditions, in order to maintain health conditions and to correctly apply the translational scientific research. Among basic sciences, a crucial role is played by subjects such as calculus, physics, chemistry, computer science, and statistics.\nb)\tThe knowledge of pathological processes and of the mechanisms that cause them, with specific attention to individual variability and to gender differences, in order also to define prevention, diagnosis and treatment in a targeted manner; under this perspective, the knowledge of the role played by lifestyle, nutrition, and physical activity in the acquisition and maintenance of health status and in the approach to pathologies is also crucial.\nc)\tThe clinical and methodological medical practice, which must be particularly solid, based on the extensive use of tutorial-professional teaching.\nd)\tHuman sciences, which should be a useful tool to achieve the awareness of being a medical doctor and of the values of the medical profession, and the ethics in doctor-patient relationship. \ne)\tThe acquisition of evidence-based scientific, medical, clinical, and professional methodology for individual or collective health issues, with specific attention to the differences among populations and to gender differences, to rare diseases and to the development of new approaches enabling a growing effectiveness of medical care as well as of palliative care and pain therapy.\nf)\tThe technologies used in the medical field, necessary for an effective and safe use of equipment and plants, as well as for the training of health technicians and staff. Crucial for this knowledge is the study of computer science, bioinformatics, electromagnetism, electro-technique and applied electronics, automation, sensors and measurements, biomechanics, solid and fluid mechanics for biological systems, as well as basic notions of signal and image processing, neuroscience, as well as the concepts of biocompatibility, regenerative medicine, micro drug delivery and tissue engineering.\ng)\tThe always more complex biomedical equipment and plants, aiming at the diagnosis and care of patients, as well as the fundamentals of the most modern biomedical engineering issues.\nIn synthesis: MED-IT graduates must be able to obtain information by the patient and to interpret them, to make clinical decisions guiding to a correct diagnosis and targeted therapeutic interventions, but also and above all, through the expert use of technologies, to which they have given their contribution during the specific application development. Their decisions must be deduced through the best clinical practices, the correct application of technology and scientific evidence, without forgetting the patient\u2019s needs and of the Healthcare systems of the Country in which they operate. Their clinical practice must be therefore based upon updated knowledge and must be ethical and capable of ensuring an efficient use of the available resources; furthermore, it must be carried out in strict \u201ccooperation-sharing\u201d with the patients and their families and with the other members of the intra-professional/inter-professional work team.\nThanks to the contribution of teachings in the biomedical engineering area, graduates will also be able to solve methodological and technological problems in the physiological and clinical fields, to carry out the analysis and modelling of bio signals and bioimages, medical robotics and computational biomechanics, and to use the relevant medical software supporting diagnostics.\nAn integral part of the educational programme consists of:\n-\tProfessional/qualifying internship, both at the University Hospital and at various local accredited healthcare facilities and hospitals, as well as in the general practitioner clinics accredited by the University, in collaboration with the Province Boards of Medical Doctors, Surgeons and Dentists.\n-\tThe mandatory optional educational activities (ADO), allowing the integration of training with the study of subjects related to other areas (both medical and scientific-engineering ones) and with the acquisition of soft skills and knowledge useful for post-graduate training and for placement.\nThe Course aims at providing a solid educational structure, and stakeholders have agreed upon the usefulness of the professional functions and skills acquired by MED-IT graduates; stakeholders are actively involved in the development process of this Degree Course with respect not only to the educational aspects, but also to the issues related to graduates\u2019 know-how. The opinion of the consulted organisations is seen as very important in this project, aiming at the training of the Medical Doctor with the above-described skills. This with a view to preparing graduates with a profile immediately spendable in the labour market and, at the same time, with solid groundings for any continuation in higher level education.\n"

The humanistic approach, providing students with the tools for the historical and anthropological understanding of assets and for their cultural and chronological positioning, is accompanied by a practical-operational approach, enabling them, through field activities, laboratories, and internships to acquire the most important methods for the recovery, conservation and restoration, as well as for the analysis and classification of the same assets, even by means of computer tools. \nArchaeology, history, history of art, literature and linguistics, geography, cultural anthropology, physical anthropology, museology, are therefore accompanied by juridical and economic subjects, as well as by computing and language skills and various practical activities, laboratories and internships. \nThe course provides for some core teachings, functional to the specificity of each curriculum; based on his/her interests, each student may choose a specific educational path through an appropriate selection among the proposed options. Guidance will be provided to make students\u2019 choices more consistent and effective.\nThe acquisition of specific techniques and methodologies, as well as the practice of various subjects, with respect also to the labour market, is achieved through specific laboratories and internships, as well as \u2013 for the archaeological heritage - through the participation in excavations and landscape archaeological surveys.\nThe attention for core subjects, as well as the presence of a good number of common courses will avoid excessive specialization. At the same time, the wide range of class-specific (archaeological, historical-artistic, geographical and juridical-economic subjects) as well as of related and integrative teachings will enable students to have a wide and articulated vision of material and immaterial cultural heritage and to increase the possibility to fit in a labour market requiring flexibility as well as a wide range of competences, and to continue their studies with 2nd cycle degrees.\n"

With the objective of ensuring advanced chemical competences and a rapid and flexible entrance in the labour market, the course has identified specific educational objectives in the most interesting sectors of chemical sciences to date: chemistry of materials, with respect to soft condensed matter as well as to hard condensed matter; chemistry of environment and cultural heritage; biochemistry and supra-molecular chemistry, chemistry teaching methodology.\nA first group of mandatory teachings has therefore been designed to complete scientific competences in the core chemical subjects (Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry and Environment Chemistry) and to introduce more advanced competences. A second group of teachings aims at specialising students through advanced specific courses. Students must therefore choose their personal curriculum choosing among various advanced courses. \nGiven the cultural and social importance of teaching scientific subjects in high schools, the 2nd cycle Degree Course in Chemistry provides, starting with academic tear 2018/2019, two teachings (6 credits each) enabling students to consciously face the issues related to historical, epistemological and methodological reflection.\nAccess to the labour market is also favoured by a cycle of seminars, (2 credits), aiming at presenting students with an overview of the relevant job opportunities. \nThe individual cultural and professional interest find their natural outcome in the preparation of degree dissertation, which is also the application of the acquired competences to a specific issue and in an educational internship in public and private companies and agencies.\n"

        "answer": "The degree course aims at providing the advanced level of knowledge and multidisciplinary methodological skills in the socio-political institutional, economic, legal, managerial, engineering, agricultural and health subjects which are adequate for the training of professionals with high level skills in the planning, organization and business development of qualified public and private services, in particular in the fields of business administration and management, work organization and human resources, security, prevention, defence and social control, as well as trade union and sustainability policies. The course therefore aims at training senior management of Public Administration bodies, companies, and private SMEs as well as professionals and managers who act in the field and can relate to and to mediate with the public administration as well as with privates. \nGraduates will also be able to operate at a high level within the public and private administration according to the principles of legality and impartiality. They must be able to promote and implement activities and initiatives of public and private intervention through the proper functioning of administrations and improving the quality of services aimed at economic and social development of the territory at regional and local level, but also within a European and international perspective, according to criteria of effectiveness, efficiency, and economy. The knowledge gained will enable graduates of the course to interpret, plan, manage the processes of change taking place in public administrations and in the services and resources organizations. \nThe program provides the methodological skills to design and implement performance management in collaborative contexts and to develop a new professional profile capable of systemically combining sustainability with the elements of \"process\" and \"responsibility\" in the creation of collaborative platforms. These professionals possess the skills of learning facilitators in the construction of group models as well as of specialists in performance management.\nStudents can combine basic studies on public administration with a specific focus on outcome-oriented performance management, applied to a variety of innovative fields, including urban governance, circular economy, governance of local areas, urban regeneration and socio-economic, cultural and ecological transition.\nThe program places particular emphasis on the crucial role of collaboration among different stakeholders as a driving force for the formulation and implementation of innovative policies supporting the holistic governance of sustainability. The principles of the so-called quintuple helix, which imply the involvement of academia, industry, government, media, civil society and other stakeholders operating in the field of ecology, constitute the founding basis of the educational approach adopted here. This integrated perspective reflects the awareness of the complexity of the challenges related to sustainability and emphasizes the power of collaboration between the different stakeholders in shaping robust and innovative policies. The mission of the program is to train its graduates not only as individuals competent in the specific disciplines addressed through the discussion of empirical cases and field projects with the stakeholders involved, but also as agents of change capable of leading collaborative and innovative processes for the common good. To achieve these objectives, the degree program is organized with specific teachings providing the acquisition of specialized skills in relevant sectors of administration as well as a critical, comparative and practical in-depth analysis of the issues related to administration in the public and private sectors. In particular, the course includes teachings such as computer science, political economy, emerging governance models, criminal law of public administration, general and economic sociology, labour law, sustainable mobility, urban governance, circular economy, governance of local areas and urban regeneration.\nDuring the first year, students acquire legal, business and collaborative governance knowledge, constituting the conceptual framework within which the other knowledge will be modulated respectively in the field of criminological research, sociology of business, economics of compliance, but also of socio-economic, cultural and ecological transition.\nThe course is based on an interdisciplinary approach that aims to develop research-intervention skills providing an \"interpretation key\" on the cause-effect links underlying the results referable to an organizational and inter-organizational dimension within a context, with reference to complex systems such as socio-economic, cultural and ecological ones. Some examples are migratory flows, climate change, terrorism, market globalization, population aging, crime prevention and control, quality of life in metropolitan urban areas and suburbs, health and sports, sustainable nutrition, pollution, natural disasters and social marginalization.\nThis knowledge is further strengthened during the second year, during which students acquire the main tools for the prevention and management of risk in public and private organizations, also in terms of workplace safety, privacy of environmental cases, as well as innovative policies to support the holistic management of sustainability. The second semester of the final year will be dedicated to external training activities and internships at national or foreign companies, public and/or private bodies, public and private organizations, on the basis of University agreements and with the interested professional bodies and organizations. In this perspective, collaboration with local and national public bodies and organizations, companies and businesses in the sector, both at local and national level, should be emphasized, also for the purpose of identifying specific training programs. The educational programme, aiming at enabling students to apply, refine and further develop the knowledge acquired, culminates in the elaboration and discussion of an original written thesis carried out under the guidance of a supervisor, one of the professors of the Degree Course, at the conclusion of a guided path of planning or research or case analysis, which may also refer to the activity carried out during the internships, showing the undergraduates ability to operate autonomously and a good level of communication. Graduates of this Course must also be able to use, in written and oral form, at least one of the reference languages of the European Union, with respect, namely to disciplinary lexicons (for these purposes, the use of manuals, texts, documents and materials in a foreign language is also foreseen in the teachings). These language skills are also an access requirements: in particular it is necessary to have a knowledge of the English language of at least B2 level\n"

        ],
        "answer": "Specific objectives:\nThe 2nd cycle  Degree in Statistics and Data Science, consistent with the requirements of the educational objectives of both classes and with the indications coming from the surveys on the employment market of graduates in statistical disciplines (such as, for example, the AlmaLaurea interuniversity initiative), aims at training graduates who, with a solid, high level, background in mathematics, probability, statistics and computer science, are able to operate in various application areas with autonomy and responsibility and to enter the labour market as qualified experts, able to produce, manage and analyse diversified information flows.\nIn particular, the CdS provides the tools to enable a solid statistical methodology and data interrogation and extraction preparation together with tools specific to some application contexts.\nThe frontal teaching activity is characterized by the strong integration between theoretical lessons and exercises and laboratories.\nThe educational structure of the Degree Course is characterized by: - the presence of a common package of advanced level teachings in mathematical, probabilistic, statistical and computer science disciplines capable of ensuring in-depth study and the acquisition of knowledge useful for subsequent methodological and applicative expansions of statistics; - a good degree of customization of the study programme by the student, to whom some customizations are recommended with reference to specific skills in some applied contexts; - attention to teaching methodologies, taking care that the solid theoretical training, based on frontal teachings, is integrated with application laboratories as much as possible in eco-digital environments in which real cases and problems will be discussed and topics of applicative relevance will be explored; - attention to the methods, tools and applications of innovative teaching (gamification, flipped classroom, etc.) and to service learning (with specific involvement of students).\nTwo curricula are also planned, taking into account the growing international demand for these specific training courses. In the proposed program, the teachings are almost entirely covered by full professors of the first and second level and, to ensure maximum adherence to the contents and training objectives, teachings are largely proposed ex novo for the new course of study, therefore with specific attention to contents designed for the specific professional profile. \nTwo curricula are foreseen. The first curriculum includes an initial core, in the first year, of advanced statistical and data science disciplines and responds to the need to maintain a chain that, based on the first level degree in statistics (L41) already active at the University for many years, develops in a coherent and specific way the skills most related to the theoretical and applied disciplinary and content tradition of statistics. \nThe curriculum emphasizes the role of statistics for complex data and for the extraction and management of big data with particular attention to the most advanced statistical modelling and with specific applications in the social and economic fields, this also thanks to a wide use of three optional groups (plus a group chosen by the student) of subjects able to guarantee sufficient thematic depth in relation to the student's interests. \nIn this sense, the first curriculum provides training oriented to the basics of stochastic processes and networks, with data mining techniques and support of advanced statistical methods and models in both the parametric and non-parametric context and with specific attention to Bayesian approaches, without neglecting data and database management, as well as the necessary legal skills on the protection, management and conservation of data, and specific application areas oriented to the company and the economic and social context of analysis. These aspects can be further specified, at the student's choice, through optional subjects (group 1 and group 2) enabling in-depth study of genetic statistics, methods of evaluation and performance of services, sampling and social surveys, financial risk analysis, territorial economic analysis, or even in terms of modelling such as biostatistics, models for categorical data, natural language processing and internet tools. The subjects are activated ex novo to ensure maximum correspondence with the training needs of the Degree Course and maximum coherence within the syllabus. Students can also add among the optional subjects (group 3) some subjects of the second curriculum and, in particular, techniques and methods on some analysis topics such as - for example - cloud computing, high dimensional data, models for volatility in finance, but subjects of a broader scope belonging to the mathematical, economic, business, sociological and computer science areas. As always, the additional group remains free to choose by the student. The second curriculum offers partially differentiated contents - also with dedicated optional subjects - to guarantee a study path in line with specific aspects of data analysis. Therefore, the second curriculum is more oriented towards the management of complex data, querying but also data structure design, placing emphasis on more computer-side and computation-intensive automatic methods also with respect to the management of high-frequency multidimensional data. Also in this curriculum, customization with optional subjects (and the group chosen by the student) enables some thematic insights, but here limited to two more specific groups with technical disciplines also aimed at completing, if necessary, the student's statistical-methodological skills. Therefore, this profile proposes, from the first year, an enhancement is that is more oriented towards statistical learning, data and text mining and advanced computation skills, without neglecting the application aspects in the economic and social fields, but now declined in terms of an approach with complex and more computer-intensive data such as modelling approaches in finance or optimization and applications in contexts of very high-frequency multidimensional data. The more strictly statistical methods are assigned to an optional group (group 1) with some specific contents exclusively for methodological in-depth study, while another optional group (group 2) provides teachings with high technical qualification such as financial econometrics, risk management, survey sampling methods, marketing decisions and advanced mathematical and computer science subjects, such as cybersecurity and the Internet of Things. Once again, the additional group (group 4) with free choice by the student allows the free addition of subjects or other training activities. Finally, the delivery in English of this second curriculum appears useful to encourage qualified international demand and to complete a broad training offer also to the advantage of local students who will have additional training opportunities on site.\nThe two curricula include a basic internship that can also be extended through the free choices of the students who, therefore, can achieve a wide coverage of credits for internships, guaranteeing maximum flexibility also based on specific needs expressed by the student or the host company.\nBoth curricula provide for an equal distribution of credits among the 4 semesters of the two years with a greater concentration of training activities in the first 3 semesters, and the last semester mostly dedicated to internships, placement and consultancy activities, as well as to elective activities .\n"

The syllabus, pursuant to the Interministerial Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022 of Law no. 163, provides that 10 credits are acquired by carrying out a practical-evaluation internship (TPV), consisting of contextualized and supervised practical activities, which involve direct observation and the execution of activities aimed at learning in situation and at the development of procedural and relational skills and abilities essential for the exercise of the professional activity.\nUpon completion of a semester of post-graduate professional internship, the degree course in 'Psychological Sciences and Techniques' allows access to the State Exam for section B of the Register of Psychologists, as well as to carry out professional activities at a technical-operational level.\nFor the Psychologist professional qualification and the enrolment in Section A of the Register, graduates must complete five-year studies. The 2nd cycle degree in the LM51 class enables graduates to practice the profession of psychologist (Interministerial Decree n. 654 of 05/07/2022).\nThe educational objective of the course of study is achieved through a path providing the theoretical and methodological tools suitable for operating effectively in:\n- activities aimed at diagnosing, understanding and supporting individuals, families and groups, in order to promote their development and well-being and limit their discomfort;\n- analysis and development of communication processes;\n- prevention, evaluation and help and support interventions in psychological discomfort connected to problems of maladjustment and social deviance, psychological trauma, physical and mental illness, risk behaviours;\n- support interventions, with particular reference to residential and semi-residential facilities for minors, families, the elderly, drug addicts, psychiatric patients;\n- activities in public and private services (maternal and child services, training and educational services, socio-educational and scholastic institutions, housing communities and social services for youth problems), aimed at promoting development, knowledge and health;\n- assessment of the child and parental figures, in the context of psychological intervention in support of the mother-child and father-child relationship, as well as in situations of social and relational distress (e.g. maternity at risk, etc.), and in support of parenthood in critical moments of the life cycle;\n- empowerment programs and interventions for individuals and local communities;\n- activities in public and private services aimed at the optimal use of human resources in work and organizational contexts, through the identification and understanding of the psychological-social processes underlying performance, interpersonal relationships and the professional objectives pursued;\n- planning of interventions with public and private administrations and bodies for the promotion of well-being, organizational development and human and professional resources;\n- evaluation of local community profiles for the definition of the quality of life of neighbourhoods, towns, services and organization and the development of spontaneous, informal and formal associative networks in the area;\n- coexistence promotion programs, also with reference to multicultural and multi-ethnic processes, support interventions in the field of reception services, in critical emergencies and in cultural mediation.\nCourse outline\nThe first year provides an adequate basic knowledge of the foundations of psychology (general psychology, psychobiology and physiological psychology, developmental and educational psychology) and an interdisciplinary training in the fields of demo-ethnoanthropological disciplines and the history of philosophy. In addition, there are teachings aiming at consolidating and updating students' knowledge in computer science, quantitative analysis and English language. All courses develop basic theoretical-methodological aspects without neglecting the practical component.\nDuring the second year, the course becomes more operational. In addition to the mandatory activities related to dynamic and clinical psychology, developmental and educational psychology, psychometrics and social statistics, there are activities connected to the practical internal evaluation training related to the relational skills of the psychologist and the laboratories on the use of the tests.\nThe s third and final year provides teachings related to the areas of dynamic, clinical, industrial, and organization psychology as well as practical activities relating to TVP, practical evaluation training (both internal and external) and practical qualitative and quantitative research laboratories.\nFinally, the course provides elective teachings, which aim to guide students towards the specific 2nd cycle degrees.\nAll courses include exercises and laboratory activities to enable students to apply their knowledge and understanding in the various professional fields to which the degree refers.\nTPV's activities not only fit into the same framework but also favour the development of soft skills.\nAt the end of the course students will have acquired basic skills related to the various areas of Psychology as well as to research and data analysis in psychology.\n"

The course aims at training experts on migration and integration issues, fundamental rights and inclusion, with high-level knowledge of the legal aspects, and able to situate such knowledge in the broader social, geo-historical and economic context. \nThe causes and socio-economic impact of human mobility, the different forms of regulation of the circulation of people and the production of borders, the rights of migrants and integration policies will be studied in a multi-level framework of relevant normative sources. The necessary tools will therefore be provided so that students can orient themselves in the different areas of regulation of the subject (international, European, national), critically evaluating the nature, content and effectiveness of policies, norms and institutions relating to migration.\nAt the end of the course, graduates:\n- will possess advanced (not exclusively legal) knowledge concerning the analysis, interpretation, evaluation and management of the main issues related to migratory phenomena and to the integration, with respect, in particular, to the European Union.\n- will be able to critically evaluate related policies, rethink assumptions and paradigms, devise and implement complex operational strategies aimed at affirming fundamental rights.\n- will be able to analyse the quantitative aspects of migratory dynamics, and to identify their causes and trends.\n- will have in-depth knowledge of the rights of migrants, in particular of vulnerable subjects such as foreign minors, and of the rules and policies to prevent discrimination and ensure equal opportunities in an intersectional perspective.\n- will master, thanks to the particular attention dedicated to the legal aspects of the phenomena themselves, as well as to the multilevel protection of migrants' rights, the tools in which current national and European policies are articulated.\n- will be able to develop projects aimed at countering the risk of exploitation and trafficking of women and minors.\n- will possess planning skills in the field of reception and integration.\n- will be able to communicate, in written and oral form, the knowledge acquired in English, as well as in Italian, with reference also to disciplinary lexicons.\nIn line with the specific educational objectives just indicated, the teachings provided in the two years enable students to deal first of all with the socio-economic causes of migratory phenomena, thanks to the involvement of courses in the historical, economic and geographical fields, to then move on to the analysis of the general legal framework of reference (with courses in international, European and constitutional law) and then focus on the rights of migrants in the relationships among private individuals and with public authorities, as well as on the regulation of the conditions and methods of access and permanence (thanks to the teachings in private, criminal, administrative, procedural, labour and philosophical-legal law) and on the strategies of inclusion in a cohesive and plural society (thanks to the  comparative law, sociology and political philosophy subjects).\nThe teachings have a calibrated approach to the specific educational objectives of the course. The close relationship of complementarity between the involved subjects is also strengthened through the proposal of integrated courses, composed of coherent modules, in which the same theme is addressed starting from different scientific-disciplinary sectors.\nFrom a purely legal perspective, the Course aims to stimulate critical thinking, the practical use of knowledge and field work. Specific teaching of legal clinics is foreseen, but the intersection between theory and practice and the adoption of innovative teaching methodologies is peculiar to several teachings.\nLanguage and Euro-project laboratories are also set up, due to specific needs emerged during consultations with the course stakeholders. In the first case, the aim pursued is to expand the communication skills of graduates who will work in multilingual and intercultural contexts; in the second case the aim is to provide the necessary tools to draw on European resources for the financing of integration projects, protection of rights, etc. Finally, to make the experience of internships at public and private organizations that operate in the sector of rights, integration and reception profitable, specific agreements have been stipulated. Career guidance is also provided, providing information on internship and employment opportunities at European and international institutions.\n"

        "answer": "The Degree Course is characterized by being delivered through the integration of the expertise of the three universities involved, which will divide the study disciplines in a balanced way. From an organizational point of view, a mixed modality was chosen, which allows the use of the training activities by the students of the three locations of the course, pursuing the following objectives:\n(1) maximize the activities in presence in each location;\n(2) guarantee in each location the interaction in presence between enrolled students;\n(3) favor the teaching activities in laboratory or active form, also according to the Problem Based Learning model (PBL - Teaching methodology adopted in many European universities and in particular in the University of Maastricht).\nIn order to pursue these goals, the following organizational and training choices will be made:\n- on an experimental basis and given the active and participatory teaching approach, a maximum number of 116 students is expected, identified through a selective procedure, distributed in 38 per location, according to the order of preference indicated by the candidates at the time of participation in the call. The selective procedure and the students' careers will be managed by the University of Palermo as the administrative headquarters, as established by the Agreement stipulated between the three Universities involved. Student services will be provided in each of the three locations\n- The teachers involved come in the amount of 1/3 (approximately) from each of the three locations, so that each cohort of students can benefit from in-person contact with the teacher.\n- In each location, students carry out 1/3 of the lessons in person and the remaining 2/3 remotely.\n- Distance learning activities are carried out in university classrooms, simultaneously for both in-person and distance learning students, so that everyone can have a cohesive and collaborative classroom experience. The presence of classroom tutors who are facilitators and group mediators allows for the coordination of communications between locations (e.g., questions from online classrooms to the in-person classroom) and, above all, the exercise/laboratory and PBL activities.\n- For the purposes of developing the problems posed according to the PBL methodology, the subject teacher can also act as a tutor-coordinator\n- A technological tutor will be present in each classroom to ensure the correct conduct of distance learning lessons. The technological tutor can also have classroom tutor skills and therefore also perform this role-\n- Laboratory teaching methodologies are adopted, carried out in person and with the supervision of specially trained tutors in each of the three locations, also according to the PBL model. The tutors, as is the case at the University of Maastricht, may be, in addition to the subject teacher, also PhD students or LM students who are interested in doing teaching practice or conducting research in this area.\n- The credits relating to the acquisition of LIS at the level of practical exercises will be provided entirely in person, in each of the locations. For this purpose, deaf teachers who sign are provided with the function of CEL Expert Linguistic Collaborators who will take care of the LIS exercises in each of the three locations.\nThe administrative headquarters is identified at the University of Palermo.\nThe educational offer of the Degree Course may be integrated/varied with flexible programming and teaching based on student assessments and periodic consultations with stakeholders. The AQ Commission and the Degree Course Coordinator will take into account their indications, adapting it to the needs expressed by the students and also to the new demands of the job market.\nThe chosen organizational method allows to make the best use of the expertise of the three university locations and will guarantee students a high level of quality of the teachings provided. Finally, to encourage the enrollment of deaf students, the CdS will, in collaboration with the ENS and other deaf associations, advertise the Course throughout the country.\nIn fact, it provides theoretical knowledge and adequate operational skills to carry out the activity of pedagogist, with functions of planning, pedagogical coordination, training of educators and promoter of change and development within different educational, training and social contexts.\nIn this perspective, it aims to develop adequate knowledge and skills:\nin the observational field, in planning and evaluation;\nin the theories, strategies and systems of education;\nin the methodologies of educational research;\nin the group dimension, in networking and supervision;\nin the processes of continuous training\nAt the same time, it also provides specific knowledge and skills to carry out the role of Pedagogist, expert in inclusive communication processes.\nIn this perspective, the Degree Course intends to provide students with adequate knowledge and skills in relation to:\n- Italian Sign Language (LIS) and the specific vocabulary of the various disciplines;\n- the history and culture of the deaf in Italy;\n- linguistics for deafness;\n- developmental and learning psychology;\n- the relationship between cognition, deafness and learning and the relationship between mind, body and language;\n- the functioning of the ear, the etiology and types of deafness, the listening aids available today (cochlear implants and hearing aids); the characteristics of lip-reading;\n- special pedagogy;\n- special teaching;\n- planning and evaluation;\n- communication and mediation strategies and techniques;\n- the relational dimension;\n- the functioning of educational and training institutions and the legislation relating to them;\n- the code of ethical conduct in work at school or in other educational and training contexts.\nIn a collegial and network perspective, the Pedagogist, expert in inclusive communication processes, will also develop the ability to work professionally alongside the support teacher, curricular teachers and other professional figures such as the Educational Operator for autonomy and communication, Cultural Educational Assistant; as well as the ability to actively collaborate in the drafting of the Dynamic-Functional Profile (PDF) and the Individualized Educational Plan (PEI).\nThe Pedagogist, expert in inclusive communication processes may find employment at schools of all levels, at educational and professional training centres, within universities as a tutor for students, in network projects with families.\nThe professionalism provided by the Degree Course will allow the expert pedagogist to carry out the following tasks:\n- developing effective teaching strategies with the curricular teachers and the support teacher to promote learning, autonomy and inclusion of deaf students.\n- making the different subjects intelligible to deaf students with their specific vocabulary, facilitating access to the contents without simplifying them.\n- playing a mediation role with the families of deaf students, coordinating their intervention with other professional figures (curricular and support teachers, ASL operators, audiologists, speech therapists, etc.).\n- activating mediation strategies in terms of communication and relationships between deaf students and their classmates and/or their teachers.\n- carrying out a mediation action together with the teachers between the family of the deaf student and the school and supporting relationships with extra-school at large.\n- facilitating learning through the use of LIS and/or in a communication mode as suitable as possible to the needs of deaf students based on their communication habits and preferences (lip repetition, writing, visual, multimedia, expressive techniques, etc.)\n- playing a consultancy and coordination role for school networks and in the territory.\n"

In this regard, a teaching of \"business English\" has been envisaged (L-LIN/12).\nInternational Relations & Trade online wants to provide learners - by combining a broad theoretical perspective with a decidedly practical and experiential cut - cultural tools suitable for operating in the world of international trade, thus promoting the companies\u2019 internationalization processes.\nThe course will be divided into four main training areas with distinct objectives:\na) The juridical one, addressing the issues of international contract law (IUS/02), the world regulation of trade in the WTO and multilateral agreements (IUS/21), transport law and international logistics (IUS/01 ), as well as customs law (IUS/12) and the protection of intellectual property (IUS/04). The aim is to make learners acquire knowledge of the legal instruments related to international trade and foreign direct investments.\nb). The historical one, addressing: the history of international commercial relations (SPS/6 - SPS/13), of processes and international economy (SECS-P/04), and the dynamics and consequences of decolonization on current markets (M-STO/04). The objective is to make the student acquire the ability to identify and select the relevant sources and data for the analysis of global political, legal, and economic processes, in a diachronic perspective.\nc) The political science one, dealing with the issue of political risk in international commercial transactions (SPS/04). The objective is to make the student acquire the ability to analyse political and security risks related to investments and international commercial transactions.\nd) The economic one, addressing issues related to the design and implementation of corporate strategies, entrepreneurial initiatives and investment policies (SECS-P/07) and to the management of the international distribution chain (ING-IND 35), aimed at supporting companies - especially small and medium size ones - in the development processes at local and international level according to a sustainability perspective, as well as in the evaluation of the organizational results - emerging from the adoption of these strategies - through the analysis of business processes and the use of appropriate performance indicators (effectiveness , efficiency, economy).\nIn this respect, the aim of this group of courses is to make students acquire theoretical knowledge and application tools aimed at supporting the governance of corporate development and the exploration of the underlying value creation processes through a sustainability approach, i.e. one that balances the perspective strategic in time (short vs long term) and in space (local, regional, national vs international level).\nKnowledge of the English language, at least equal to B/2, which is a prerequisite for accessing the course and the vehicular language of all teachings, will be further improved thanks to the inclusion of a specialist English subject, \"business English\" (L- LIN/12), with the objective of deepening the specialist language and communication techniques in the negotiation field.\nAn annual workshop, included among other useful knowledge for entering the labour market, will be dedicated to digital export and digital marketing, thus implementing the suggestions of stakeholders.\nThe educational programme culminates in the elaboration and discussion of an original written thesis carried out under the guidance of a supervisor among the teachers of the course of study, possibly accompanied by an external co-supervisor coming from the bodies in which the student carried out the training internship.\n"

This degree course aims to produce graduates with advanced preparation, able to respond professionally and scientifically to various biological issues, through the use of modern biomolecular techniques and their interpretation. Students will obtain solid theoretical and practical groundings, thanks to the activity carried out during the experimental thesis period. The Degree Course offers the chance to acquire advanced skills about the cellular, biochemical and physiological processes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including humans, about the normal functioning of organisms (prokaryotes and eukaryotes) and the main causes of homeostatic alterations at molecular, cellular and organ level. The aim of the Degree Course is to train graduates who possess a solid background on molecular, genetic and cell techniques, knowing and knowing how to identify the factors that may affect human health. In any case, students will have the opportunity to choose a curriculum specifically related to the cellular and molecular aspects of biology or a curriculum in which they acquire more knowledge about the factors that may affect human health. Graduates will be able to spend the acquired knowledge in the workplace both in basic research laboratories and in the health sector laboratories (environmental, nutritionist, pharmacological). The above knowledge and understanding are achieved by graduates, through lectures with mandatory attendance, exercises, and self-study, provided by the specific educational activities in the following sectors: BIO/O6, BIO/09, BIO/10, BIO/11, BIO/18. In the second year of the degree course, more than two-thirds of activities are focused at the development of the thesis with the aim to provide students, through a significant experience of experimental work in the laboratory, the opportunity to acquire both cultural tools and critical analysis skills which are necessary not only to carry out research but also for the development of leadership skills. The  Degree Course is, in fact, a suitable cultural basis for the continuation of advanced training through PhD programs.\n"

Therefore they are capable to prepare an integrated supply system, thanks to their interpersonal skills and problem solving abilities, aiming at increasing cohesion among stakeholders and at pursuing coherent development objectives. With respect to demand, the area of study therefore includes: the motivations to travel, the process driving to the choice of a service, the consumer behaviours, the de-standardisation of tourism, the demand for tourism workers (in professional and cultural terms), the tourist\u2019 cultural models, the social evolution of lifestyles. With respect to the supply: the exploitation of environmental, natural, historical and cultural resources, the organization and management of hotel areas and of local attraction, the local cultural production, the quality of service, the use of new marketing technologies and the different promotion of tourist products and services.\nStudents will be able to effectively communicate in English language, as well as in another European Union language, chosen among French and Spanish.\nFinally, they know how to use effectively the computer tools for the use and management of contents and statistical data related to the tourism sector.\nThese skills are acquired through lectures, exercises, language laboratories, as well as through the participation in conferences and seminars, organized by the Degree Course. During the course, students must also pass written and oral tests, also mid-term ones, aiming at improving their learning. Furthermore, particular attention is paid by the Degree Course to the organization and management of the internship, considering it functional to the maturation of an experience not only providing students a knowledge of the dynamics of the world of work, but above all activating processes of 'learning by doing '.\nThe teaching method pursued in the Degree Course integrates different approaches:\na) descriptive \u2013 qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tourism phenomenon; \nb) inductive- analysis of the cause/effect relationships underlying the tourism phenomenon; \nc) deductive - analysis of the consequences produced by the occurrence of phenomena; \nd) comparative \u2013 comparison among the adoptable solutions and operational decisions.\nThe teaching material for the individual courses will combine national and international manuals, popular and scientific articles useful to enable students to develop a sound and articulated theoretical-conceptual preparation for the formulation of the strategy of the tourism company, as well as to support the policy-maker in the territorial choices for the promotion of tourism. A practical focus is provided through the application of the acquired theoretical knowledge to the analysis of real cases, aimed at highlighting the main problems and challenges arising from changes in demand and from the acceleration of competitive dynamics in the tourism sector. The course provides a number of credits adequately distributed among basic activities (Law, English and other European Languages, Business Economics, Business Economics and Management, Geography) aiming at providing students with solid scientific groundings on which to set up their specific study, which is declined in the various class-specific educational activities (Basic and Applied Statistics, Applied Economics, Economic Policy, Finance, Art History, Museology) to allow particular harmonization among the various disciplines, qualifying the specificity of the course educational offer, divided in three profiles. \nThe first profile provides students with articulated knowledge on the creation and appropriation of value of companies operating in the tourism sector. In general, attention will be focused on how a company can obtain an advantage over its rivals and maintain it over time. \nThe second profile provides knowledge and tools related to the formulation of territorial policies at different levels - local, regional, national and European - and to the analysis and management of tourist destinations. \nThe third profile combines basic economic and managerial knowledge for the tourist development of the territories with the integrated and sustainable management of the cultural and natural resources of a territory.\n"

Operators in agriculture will have to deal increasingly with the demands and rules dictated by large-scale retail trade, by current regulations on food safety and by changes in lifestyles and consumption styles. All this requires the training of professionals fully aware of the use of non-renewable resources and of the greater efficiency of the technical means that the agronomic sciences provide and, therefore, to use them as a guarantee for the agricultural entrepreneur and the final consumer, in line with the main international standards for the quality certification of production processes and in compliance with the principles of sustainable development set out in the 2030 agenda with particular reference to goals no. 2 (zero hunger) and no. 12 (responsible production and consumption) and to the European green deal.\nThe training project is characterized by the presence of basic teachings (mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, genetics and genetic improvement), class-specific and related teachings (soil fertility, hydraulic design in a Mediterranean environment, general agronomy and techniques of dry farming, phytoremediation and reuse of waste water in agriculture, management of the olive growing chain, tropical and sub-tropical fruit trees chain in the Mediterranean environment, elements of nursery and horticultural production, herbaceous cropping systems for hot arid environments, principles of mechanics and mechanization in agriculture, principles of agriculture economics and rural appraisal, certifications applicable to the primary production sector, animal husbandry and agricultural crop protection.\nAll the teachings envisaged in the L-SAM training course include at least 30% of activity dedicated to laboratory and field practice and/or technical visits.\nThe specific educational objectives of each course are listed below.\nElements of mathematics and physics: The fundamental objective of the course is to provide students with the main tools for analysing problems from a mathematical and physical point of view. Therefore, the learning objectives will be:\n1. Promoting intuitive and logical ability;\n2. Acquiring abstraction and formalization skills;\n3. Developing the attitude to critically review and logically systematize the acquired knowledge;\n4. Getting used to the application of analysis and synthesis skills to concrete problems.\n5. Getting used to the search for alternative constructive solutions.\n6. Getting used to generalize the solution of a specific problem in algorithms.\n7. Strengthening the ability to use mathematical methods, tools and models in different situations.\n8. Promoting the understanding of the transversal concepts of the discipline and getting used to grasping structural analogies between different fields.\nApplied botany and elements of plant physiology - The teaching aims to provide knowledge on the biodiversity of plants and fungi and on the morphological and functional organization of plant and fungal organisms in Mediterranean agricultural systems, to create sustainable and efficient production solutions.

Therefore, the practical experiences of the continuous and updated research of the teachers are poured into the teachings.\nThe Degree Course aims at training experts in the agro-engineering management of the rural territory and experts in the forest-wood system. The specific objective of the Degree Course is to develop the skills needed to face and manage complex problems, namely in: i) the precision management of agricultural production systems; ii) the use and management of water resources; iii) the territorial planning and analysis of production processes; iv) the management and conservation of forest ecosystems; v) the organization and enhancement of the forest-wood supply chain and biomass production; vi) the survey, representation and defence of the territory, the management and restoration of hydro-geological instability; vii) the organization and management of agro-forestry companies also in relation to the European Union guidelines for agro-environmental policies.\nThe inter-class 2nd cycle degree course in \"Agroengineering and Forestry Sciences and Technologies\" provides in the first year a common curricular path including teachings mainly in the economic-legal, production, forestry and environmental, defence, agricultural engineering fields. In the second year, the path is divided into two profiles, a first (class LM-69) mainly oriented towards the agro-engineering management of the territory and a second one (class LM-73) characterized by aspects linked to the forest-wood system. In particular, graduates acquire, through the Lm-69 path, specialist skills related to the design of agro-engineering works, the planning and management of the agro-forest territory with particular attention to the protection of natural resources, soil protection, to management through modern precision agriculture technologies. The issues related to the management and protection of the forest heritage, the enhancement of wood and non-wood products, the management of agro-forestry companies, the planning and management of the agro-forestry territory with particular attention to the protection of natural resources, the soil defence, are privileged in the LM-73 path.\nEducational activities consist of lectures, laboratory and field exercises, specialized seminars, and possible ongoing tests. To achieve the final qualification, students must have acquired 120 credits (CFU). Each frontal credit corresponds to 10 hours, while each CFU reserved for exercises, laboratory activities corresponds to 12 hours. The educational programme consists of 12 mandatory exams including elective activities, other training activities aimed at acquiring in-depth linguistic knowledge, as well as highly professional skills directly linked to the labour market, carried out in laboratory form (9 CFU). \nWith reference to these activities, it is worth specifying that the course includes activities related to the agricultural sector, to the agricultural industry, to precision agriculture technologies and to the defence from the main plant diseases, as well as to the forestry sector, with laboratory activities related to mycology, geomatics and reforestation techniques. The student's training is completed by a practical/applicative internship at accredited premises, such as Italian and foreign companies (through the Erasmus + Traineeship program), public and private agencies, professional firms, non-governmental organizations. The educational programme is completed by finally by the final exam related to specific topics addressed during the course.\nOn the basis of the choice made, at the end of the Course students can obtain the 2nd cycle Degree in \"Agroengineering and Forestry Sciences and Technologies\" in class LM-69 or in class LM-73, and after passing the relevant national qualification examination, they can register in section A of the professional register of the Board of Doctors of Agronomy and Forestry.\n"

During the first year, students will mainly acquire the typical L-30 basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, mathematics typical as well as, for the aspects most related to the training of opticians, knowledge of geometric optics and anatomy. During the second year students will deepen their knowledge of basic physics up to Modern Physics and, with respect to the aspects more strictly related to the optician training, they will acquire knowledge of biochemistry, eye physiology and pathology.\nThe third year provides skills related to the study of the structure of matter, materials and biomaterials for optics, optical instrumentation for astronomy and biophysics. During the three years, given the vocational nature of the course, students will spend professional practice periods at facilities outside the university, hosting laboratories equipped with modern and updated equipment.\nFurthermore, to ensure a high and consistent quality of training, specialist internships are envisaged during the various years of the course, providing theoretical and practical training, as reported in the course outline. These specialized training courses will be taught by professionals recruited through a special call open only to professionals outside the University, also within specific agreements of the Degree Course with local and national Research Institutes, Companies, Schools and Professional Associations. These traineeships provide students with the basics necessary to deal with awareness and profit the subsequent practical. These practical activities will also provide the skills necessary to access the qualification exam. \nIn accordance with the internship regulations, an University tutor, coordinating the activities and ensuring the compliance with the agreed program will accompany the specialized competence of the professionals involved The activities will be certified on special registers and a final report about the acquired knowledge will be provided. Given the number of training credits provided for the curricular internship activities (50 credits), a special Commission will be set up, to handle the procedural and documentary procedures with the subjects that will host the students and will support the tutoring commission in monitoring the progress of students' training throughout the curricular internship. A Coordinator of the Internship activities will be appointed; this professional will work in close collaboration with the Coordinator of the Board of the Degree Course.\n"

It provides for educational activities completing and deepening the acquired mathematical competences. It is designed to permit attendance also to students coming from other, similar, 1st cycle courses and wishing to develop their studies with a strong mathematical emphasis. The course aims at training graduates with advanced knowledge of the scientific method and sound theoretical, methodological and applicative groundings in the principal mathematical areas. The course develops analysis and synthesis capabilities, as well as the capability of translating interdisciplinary issues into a mathematical language and of identifying solutions for complex problems. The course might be articulated in different curricula, depending on the cultural interests of individual students and/or on professional opportunities. For instance, it may privilege one or more areas of pure mathematics, also in the perspective of further studies, such as a PhD, or applied mathematics or core mathematics and teaching methodologies. The cultural and methodological training will enable in any case the placement of graduates in areas, which are not strictly scientific, requiring planning and managerial capabilities.  The course consists of lectures, practice sessions and integrative seminars. Independent practice encourages students to explore the limits of their abilities. Students can receive handouts of the lessons (also available online) or have one or more reference texts. Examinations typically consist of written tests and/or an oral interviews. The final examination consists of a dissertation, consistent with the course outline, in which the student, under the guidance of a supervisor, must demonstrate independence and originality.\n"

        "answer": "Specific objectives:\nThe educational programme of the Degree Course in Economics and Finance aims at providing students with an adequate understanding of the functioning of modern economic and financial processes and systems. This acquisition occurs primarily through knowledge of the fundamental principles of the four disciplinary areas of the degrees in Economic Sciences, namely economic theory, business economics, the foundations of public and private law and basic mathematical and statistical disciplines. In this sense, the degree course responds to the primary need to ensure general contents to the preparation of students, enabling them to undertake professional profiles with greater specialization content. The objective is to train economists, able to describe and interpret economic phenomena both at the system level and at the market level with particular attention to understanding the interactions between economics and finance. These professionals will be able to operate at the intermediate management level both in the private and public employment sectors. With reference to the aspect related to the interpretation of phenomena, graduates in Economics and Finance will possess and use, on the one hand, the tools of financial analysis and the techniques connected to modern finance and, on the other, the specific knowledge connected to the problems related to public policies and applied economics, with particular reference to the phenomena related to economic and territorial development. The course offers students the analytical and quantitative tools necessary for modern economic analysis and, at the same time, the indispensable knowledge of the institutional structures affecting and orienting the markets dynamics. In this sense, graduates in Economics and Finance will be able to examine individual decision-making processes and interpret systemic facts also through the forecasting of economic and financial movements at the micro and macro levels.\nThe structure of the Degree Course includes a large core of common teachings (two in the theoretical disciplines of economics, at least one course more oriented to the normative aspects of economics, historical disciplines of the economic field, general mathematics, at least two courses of statistical content (one of which is basic), private law and public law, English language, computer science, a group of specific teachings aimed at financial analysis (other private legal disciplines, monetary economics, financial mathematics, management of financial intermediaries, corporate finance) and another group of specific teachings aimed at applied economic analysis (in the field of territorial economics, other social sciences, analysis of the business system). The possible differentiations between the training profiles justify the wide range of credits within the class specific activities of the economic and statistical-mathematical fields.\n"

        "answer": "The 2nd cycle Degree in History, Anthropology and Geography provides specialist knowledge of historical issues related to Europe in the global context, and of the issues related to man-environment relation particularly in the modern and contemporary age. \nThe historical curriculum trains students in the methodologies of research and production of historical knowledge, taking into account the acquisitions and revisions of the historiographical tradition, especially in terms of the critical treatment of documentary, narrative and other sources, also in light of the current use of information technology. Specifically investigated areas are those of political history and of economic, institutional, social, cultural and religious history. \nIn the anthropological-geographic curriculum, the Course aims at building specialized skills in anthropological and geographic studies, both under the theoretical and methodological perspective, designed to deal critically with geographic information systems and cartographic representations and to elaborate models of reading and interpretation of complex territorial systems, thanks to the use of information and multimedia technologies.\nCourse outline\nThe historical curriculum, starting from adequate basic knowledge, is developed through class-specific teaching courses located in two main chronological areas of European history (History of Medieval Europe, M-STO/01, History of Modern Europe, M-STO/02). Class-specific activities enable to set up historiographical, methodological and didactic problems (sources and methods of modern history, M-STO/02), while the reflection on the concepts of interpretation, the close observation of aspects and crucial cruxes of the European affair, with special reference to the Mediterranean area, are entrusted to a range of related disciplines in the M-STO/01 sectors. Medieval history, M-STO/02 Modern history and M-STO/04 Contemporary history . These disciplines focus the study on the specificities of the Mediterranean area (History of the Mediterranean in the Middle Ages, History of the Mediterranean in the Modern Age) or on the problems of sources (Exegesis of medieval sources), on institutional aspects (Institutions of the modern age, History of thought and political institutions SPS/02), on the problems of ecclesiastical history (History of the Churches in the Modern Age). Along these paths, other class-specific subjects provide thematic and disciplinary cuts of different nature and breadth (Cultural Anthropology M-DEA/01, Economic History SECS-P/12, Cultural Geography GGR-01), intended to incorporate historical knowledge into the problematic and methodological context of the human sciences. Furthermore, an important class-specific methodological discipline such as Archiving (M-STO/08) contributes to a rigorous training in the treatment of historical sources, together with the two Laboratories (Other activities) for the applications of digital technologies to historical studies.\n6 credits related to training internships allow students to apply the acquired skills, namely the ones useful for a future job placement in the communication, management and enhancement of cultural heritage.\nThe anthropological-geographic curriculum is based on a large group of disciplines that characterize the two thematic areas (Cultural Anthropology, European Ethnology, Social Anthropology, all of the M-DEA/01 sector, Cultural Geography GGR/01), intended to provide fundamental tools for the study of these areas in their various forms, with reference to the most current issues of multiculturalism and social transformations. Other class-specific subjects, common to the two curricula (Archiving M-STO/08, Sources and methods of modern history M-STO/01) - as well as the aforementioned laboratories \u2013 aim at providing skills related to the treatment of sources, while the two class-specific historical subjects (History of Medieval Europe M-STO/01, History of Modern Europe M-STO/02, Economic History SECS-P/12) - analogously to the anthropological and geographical disciplines in the historical curriculum - aim at combining the specific training of the curriculum with in-depth knowledge of the history of Europe.\nThe related disciplines in the sectors GGR/02 (Urban geography and territorial organization) and M-DEA/01 (Ethno-anthropology and Anthropology of language) are important lines of deepening anthropological and geographical studies in key sectors of the current perspectives of these cultural areas, such as environmental problems, linguistic identities, interculturalism.\n"

        "answer": "The Degree course provides full advanced training in Archaeology, with respect, in particular, to classic archaeology, which benefits of a long study tradition in the University of Palermo, as well as to pre-classic and post-classic archaeology, and to applied sciences. The course has a strong humanistic approach, aiming at providing students not only with the historical understanding of archaeological evidence (sites, monuments or artifacts), but also with the ability to situate it in its context independently and critically, drawing on various documentary sources, from literary or epigraphic text to the evidences of the settlement or material culture. The course also provides methodological and applied expertise, thanks to the technical and scientific subjects (applied physics and chemistry for archaeology) and laboratory activities, also aiming at the experimentation of computer tools for recording, analysing, querying and processing archaeological data. Through practical activities included in the field of \u201cother educational activities\u201d and internships/stage at Agencies and Institutions for the management and defence of Cultural Heritage, students acquire the ability to conduct field work (whether archaeological excavation, surface research or analysis of artefacts) independently, but under the guidance of a research manager and/or within work groups. Students will autonomously choose the specific curriculum best fitting their personal interests, in the field of classical , post-classical or middle East archaeology, with a historical-artistic approach, or an approach focusing on material culture and settlements, or on methodology and applied sciences. Laboratory and/or field activities are awarded with adequate credits, giving students the chance to learn specific experimental techniques and to practice various archaeological disciplines on field (through excavation, landscape archaeological research, analysis of artefacts). Given the commitment in terms of time for gathering, classifying and processing research data, the final examination is awarded with the maximum number of possible credits. Particular attention is paid to study experiences abroad, through the Erasmus programme, namely with the University of Gottingen for the double degree awarded at selected students having attended a semester at the partner institution.\n"

        "answer": "The growing complexity and the dynamics of the competitive system, in the age of globalization and digitalisation require a new type of professionals, capable of facing issues in an interdisciplinary, flexible and innovative way. \nManagement engineers are an answer to current market needs, therefore they are always more appreciated and required both by companies and by public administrations. \nManagement engineering deals with the solution to technical, economical, operational and organizational problems in the processes of production and delivery of goods and services, through the typical engineering scientific methods and capabilities. \nManagement engineers, in their activity, use the quantitative tools, decision supports and methodological rigour typical of engineering sciences, aiming at optimizing solutions. The engineering vision and method, when applied to managerial and organizational problems, enable the achievement of the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in solutions, contribute to a better understanding of business phenomena, facilitate the identification and control of the most significant decisional variables in various business processes, set the bases for the continuous improvement of business outcomes, based on measurable parameters and, eventually, are suitable to build well-structured relations among the various business functions and among companies. \nWhile the preparation of a 1st cycle management engineer is based on a solid basic training built on disciplines such as mathematics, physics, economics, statistics, operational research, computer science and on the design skills borrowed from the main engineering disciplines, supplemented by class-specific subjects, such as those relating to the sectors of production technologies, industrial plants and economic-management engineering, the educational objective of the 2nd cycle course focuses more on managerial training.\nIn particular, the educational objective to train an engineer-manager, translates into two specific sub-objectives:\nThe FIRST specific OBJECTIVE is to transfer the so-called 'hard' knowledge and skills of engineering managerial training to the student engineer, i.e. to provide advanced, specialized and scientific knowledge of managerial issues ranging from project management to innovation management, marketing, corporate finance, strategy, supply chain management, as well as advanced technical skills for the  application of acquired knowledge, such as the ability to manage complex projects and to carry out quantitative and statistical analysis of business processes. Particular emphasis is also paid to change management processes for the digitalization of the business and for the conversion to circular economy.\nTo achieve the first specific objective mentioned above, the training course is divided into 3 Learning Areas, which correspond to 3 blocks of teachings:\n- The Disciplines constituting the methodological basis of the second level Management Engineer; the deepening of the statistical methods for management engineering, the methodologies of analysis and modelling of business processes, the methodologies for project management;\n- The Disciplines related to the managerial training of the second level Management Engineer, the so-called traditional management knowledge: teachings related to business functions such as marketing, finance, strategy, supply chain and operations management and cross-functional subjects such as the management of technological innovation and the planning and management of customer satisfaction and human resources.\n- The in-depth teachings on management issues, the so-called advanced management knowledge, relating to the aspects and challenges of business 4.0, environmental and social sustainability, digital transformation, market globalization, organizational entrepreneurship. These advanced teachings find space within specific in-depth CURRICULA, enabling students to customize their training plan according to the type of in-depth study they choose.\nThe SECOND specific training OBJECTIVE is to increase the so-called 'soft skills', which are extremely important for an exhaustive managerial training. Listening and communication skills, teamwork, flexibility and leadership have always been an important requirement for those who aspire to become managers. Furthermore, in our globalized and highly competitive economy, soft skills have become a core competence. In addition, digital transformation has made the role of these skills even more relevant. The implementation of digital transformation plans for companies and production sectors requires much more than technologies. The skills to relate, negotiate, lead and sponsor change are even more crucial, because cultural transformation is the basis of digital transformation.\nTo meet the second specific educational objective, the teaching methodologies and the contents of the individual teachings of the course are designed to stimulate:\n- The development of soft skills related to team working, self-entrepreneurship, leadership. All teachings include educational activities of a 'design' nature and use typical MBA teaching methodologies such as group-projects, case studies, flipped-classrooms, in-class discussions, precisely to stimulate these soft-skills.\n- The development of soft skills related to the attitude to internationalization and the global vision of the markets. In addition, the fact that the course is delivered in English means that international students are present in the classroom and creates an international atmosphere that can stimulate discussion and group projects towards a spirit of globalization.\n- Interest in knowledge and technical skills related to the management of digital transformation and technological change in all company and business processes. In particular, the interactive and design teaching methodologies, as well as some theoretical contents aim explicitly at developing the need for digital skills required by the Digital Europe 2021-2027 Program. The goal is to improve Europe's competitiveness in the global digital economy and achieve technological sovereignty. This is possible only by implementing and developing new digital technologies, in order to support the digital transformation that will guarantee high quality public services for the benefit of citizens and businesses.\nFinally, we want to reiterate that the 2nd cycle degree course in management engineering is designed as a tech-MBA and, as such, the share of interactive and collaborative training activities (for example flipped-classroom or in-class discussion) are essential for increase the student's soft skills (as described above).\n"

It is organized in such a way as to provide adequate preparation in core and class-specific subjects.\nThe first year aims at providing biomedical knowledge (anatomy, biology and genetics, physiology), as well as the fundamentals of professional discipline (general nursing, psychology and bioethics), necessary to face the first internship experience, aiming at guiding the student to the professional fields of reference and to the acquisition of basic assistance skills.\nThe second year aims at deepening the physio-pathological, pharmacological and clinical-assistance knowledge to tackle the most common health problems of medicine (internal medicine, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, oncology) and surgery (general surgery, urology) with preventive interventions, aimed at the diagnosis (radiology) and the management of the acute and chronic phase of the disease. During the second year the student also acquires knowledge and skills related to nursing care in these areas, including rehabilitation. Specific educational activities are also planned to develop methodological skills to understand scientific and nursing research.\nThe third year provides in-depth specialization and the acquisition of methodologies related to professional practice, as well as the ability to work in a team; knowledge and skills relating to maternal and child care and emergency-urgency are also provided. The interpersonal skills necessary to interact with patients, caregivers, and with the institutional and professional system are developed through the teachings of human sciences and educational psychology (forensics, clinical psychology).\nAlongside the frontal teaching activity in English, there is a parallel guided internship path, also divided into three years, in which the student, always supported by an English-speaking clinical tutor, learns and applies a series of interventions aimed at planning the nursing work; the internship, whose programs are commensurate to the degree of knowledge that the student possesses in a given year of course, involves increasing degrees of complexity of the interventions performed so that, at the end of the studies, a graduate in Nursing is able to perform the work of a nurse in complete autonomy.\n"

        "answer": "The degree course in Tourism, territories and Businesses provides competences in the economic, business, statistic, legal. geographical, historical- artistic, linguistic, and demo-ethno-anthropological sectors, with respect to the tourism phenomenon. \nStudents of this course are prepared for an integrated interpretation of the phenomenon, under an interdisciplinary perspective. Therefore they are capable to prepare an integrated supply system, thanks to their interpersonal skills and problem solving abilities, aiming at increasing cohesion among stakeholders and at pursuing coherent development objectives. With respect to demand, the area of study therefore includes: the motivations to travel, the process driving to the choice of a service, the consumer behaviours, the de-standardisation of tourism, the demand for tourism workers (in professional and cultural terms), the tourist\u2019 cultural models, the social evolution of lifestyles. With respect to the supply: the exploitation of environmental, natural, historical and cultural resources, the organization and management of hotel areas and of local attraction, the local cultural production, the quality of service, the use of new marketing technologies and the different promotion of tourist products and services.\nStudents will be able to effectively communicate in English language, as well as in another European Union language, chosen among French and Spanish.\nFinally, they know how to use effectively the computer tools for the use and management of contents and statistical data related to the tourism sector.\nThese skills are acquired through lectures, exercises, language laboratories, as well as through the participation in conferences and seminars, organized by the Degree Course. During the course, students must also pass written and oral tests, also mid-term ones, aiming at improving their learning. Furthermore, particular attention is paid by the Degree Course to the organization and management of the internship, considering it functional to the maturation of an experience not only providing students a knowledge of the dynamics of the world of work, but above all activating processes of 'learning by doing '.\nThe teaching method pursued in the Degree Course integrates different approaches:\na) descriptive \u2013 qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tourism phenomenon; \nb) inductive- analysis of the cause/effect relationships underlying the tourism phenomenon; \nc) deductive - analysis of the consequences produced by the occurrence of phenomena; \nd) comparative \u2013 comparison among the adoptable solutions and operational decisions.\nThe teaching material for the individual courses will combine national and international manuals, popular and scientific articles useful to enable students to develop a sound and articulated theoretical-conceptual preparation for the formulation of the strategy of the tourism company, as well as to support the policy-maker in the territorial choices for the promotion of tourism. A practical focus is provided through the application of the acquired theoretical knowledge to the analysis of real cases, aimed at highlighting the main problems and challenges arising from changes in demand and from the acceleration of competitive dynamics in the tourism sector. The course provides a number of credits adequately distributed among basic activities (Law, English and other European Languages, Business Economics, Business Economics and Management, Geography) aiming at providing students with solid scientific groundings on which to set up their specific study, which is declined in the various class-specific educational activities (Basic and Applied Statistics, Applied Economics, Economic Policy, Finance, Art History, Museology) to allow particular harmonization among the various disciplines, qualifying the specificity of the course educational offer, divided in three profiles. \nThe first profile provides students with articulated knowledge on the creation and appropriation of value of companies operating in the tourism sector. In general, attention will be focused on how a company can obtain an advantage over its rivals and maintain it over time. \nThe second profile provides knowledge and tools related to the formulation of territorial policies at different levels - local, regional, national and European - and to the analysis and management of tourist destinations. \nThe third profile combines basic economic and managerial knowledge for the tourist development of the territories with the integrated and sustainable management of the cultural and natural resources of a territory.\n"

History, Policies, Cultures\u201d aims at providing students with competences enabling them to acquire critical awareness of the relations among events and processes of the contemporary age and the past. The interdisciplinary approach to historical processes, read under a cultural, socio-economic and anthropological perspective, the acquisition of the relevant study methods, their connection with geographical and political teachings, provide a solid basic knowledge of global phenomena under a comparative perspective.\nThe Degree Course is structured in a single curriculum, aiming at providing solid training, focused on the knowledge of the most important institutional, economic, social, cultural, and religious phenomena from the ancient to the contemporary age. The educational programme provides students, in the first and second year, basic notions about the main historical periods as well as the knowledge of the methods of social sciences, useful for historical analysis (geography, political philosophy, political economics, anthropology). During the second and third course year, the course provides notions related to various areas of historical analysis and enables students to build an educational path responding to their specific interests. In fact, through the various options of the educational programme and using free credits, students will be able to get advanced knowledge in their specific area of interest. During the last year, students have the chance to learn the basics of sociological subjects and to analyse in depth paths connected to globalisation and to religious and cultural interaction. In addition, the choice to provide, in the third course year, a large group of optional subjects responds to the wish to provide students with the possibility of integrating their programme with further perspectives on globalism, through teachings covering political, social, literary areas, also in preparation of the 2nd cycle studies. This perspective will be further enriched by educational activities (credits \u201cF\u201d of the course syllabus) enhancing students\u2019 informed participation as well as the consolidation of the theoretical and methodological tools acquired in the three years.\nThe educational programme has been designed taking into account two factors: the importance to follow a chronological order of historical subjects, to enable students to learn the evolution of phenomena; the will to include in the first year, and in the first semester of the second year subjects which, although not being propaedeutic to other subjects, provide students with functional knowledge and methodologies to tackle the teachings provided in the 2nd semester of the second year, and in the third year. \nIt is believed that this educational framework can guarantee students a greater ease of understanding avoiding, therefore, slowdowns in their careers. At the end of the programme students will be able to use the most common IT tools useful for human sciences (on-line databases, bibliographic and source repertories, GIS methodologies).\nFurthermore, it is believed that such organisation enables students to face the final examination with methodological and critical awareness having acquired, at the same time, the skills needed to start a 2nd cycle course.\nThe Degree Course in \u201cGlobal Studies. History, Policies, Cultures\u201d includes educational activities grouped as follows: a) basic educational activities; b) class-specific educational activities; c) educational activities in one or more related or integrative areas, with respect also to context cultures and interdisciplinary education; d) elective activities; e) educational activities for further linguistic knowledge f) laboratory activities.\n"

        "answer": "Profile:\nDental hygienist\nFunctions:\nThe course in \"Dental Hygiene\" is part of the class L/SNT3 TECHNICAL HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONS.\nGraduates in this class L/SNT3, pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 3 of Legislative Decree no. 502 of 30 December 1992 and subsequent amendments and additions, pursuant to Law No 42 of 26 February 1999 and to Law no. 251, are health professionals whose field of activity and responsibility is determined by the contents of the ministerial decrees setting up professional profiles and by the educational programmes of their respective university and post-graduate courses as well as specific codes of ethics.\nAt the end of the training cycle, the profile is that of a healthcare professional of the technical care class (dental hygienist) working in the healthcare, carrying out with professional title and autonomy, technical care activities, as provided for in the regulations concerning the identification of the figures and their professional profiles defined by decree of the Minister of Health.\nThe general cultural profile provides that graduates in dental hygiene are adequately trained in basic disciplines, enabling them to better understand the most important elements that are the basis of oro-dental (oral cavity) pathologies arising in the developmental, adult and geriatric age, upon which they carry out their actions for the improvement of oral health (through primary prevention, secondary prevention or therapeutic assistance). They must also be able to use at least one language of the European Union, besides Italian, in the specific professional field. \nMore in detail, the Degree Course in Dental Hygiene, even though a technical course, provides also competences in prevention: prevention and assistance are the two natural areas in which every dental hygienist works.\nGraduates in dental hygiene will carry out the activities provided by the Decree of the Ministry Of Health, 15 March 1999, no. 137 and successive modifications and integrations; that is to say, they carry out tasks related to the prevention of or-dental affections of any age group, as indicated by dental practitioners and medical surgeons qualified to practice dentistry, \nDental Hygiene graduates perform dental health education and participate in primary prevention projects of dental health, also within the public healthcare system; they collaborate on the compilation of the dentist's clinical record and deal with the collection of technical-statistical data; Provide the deplaquing of dental surfaces, the ablation of the tartar and the sanding of roots, as well as the topical application of various prophylactic means; they provide instruction on the various oral hygiene methods and on the use of diagnostic tools to highlight bacterial plaque and microbiological colonization, motivating the need for periodic clinical controls; they explain the rules of a rational diet for the protection of dental health. Current oral health demand is reflected in the demand for a combination of basic and professional skills that result in the formation of a professional profile of the expert in Oral Health Prevention, of both the individual patient and of the community. The dental hygienist may be employed in the design, production, management of oral health prevention services, in the provision of professional health services (eg dental deplaquing, tartar ablation, periodontal survey, dental charts compilation, surface sealing seals), in the use of non-invasive medical devices for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and in the use of appropriate medical diagnostic software (eg digital periodontal survey, crevicular fluid extraction, alitometry).\nThe WHO's Global Goals to be achieved by 2020 establish, with scientific evidence, the need to guide public health policy towards projects relating to oral health and lifestyles. Among healthcare professionals in the technical-care class, hygienists have the skills to deal with primary prevention (proper lifestyles) and secondary prevention by intercepting signs and symptoms of serious diseases such as oral cancer, and at the same time with oral healthcare through hygiene interventions in the oral cavity that improve the state of health at all ages.\nThe profession of dental hygienist can be carried out in different areas: the private one within the dental surgeries, where they provide access to quality care, the public facilities (local health companies, public hospitals, University hospitals), where they operate in prevention services, as well as in scientific research, the community social services, elderly and long-term residences, centers for disabilities, schools.\nIn all these areas, the activity of dental hygienists improves the cost/benefit ratio of dental care due to the preventive character of their work.\nIn the modern conception of oral cavity medicine, dental hygienists are, directly or on the advice of the dentist, in charge of the oral health care of the patient (adult or child) with chronic or neoplastic systemic pathology (ie special care) at public or private healthcare facilities.\nFinally, graduates in Dental Hygiene can continue their training in the Italian Universities providing 2nd cycle degrees (http://www.aiditalia.it/sedi-laurea-specialistica/).\nProfessional opportunities:\nGraduates in Dental Hygiene can work both as private practitioners and in hospitals, health care facilities, and also in research centers and universities. In fact, they are  healthcare professionals as provided by the Decree of the Ministry of Health of March 15, 1999, No.137 and subsequent modifications and additions, who carry out, as assigned by dentists and medical surgeons legitimate to the practice of dentistry, tasks related to the prevention of oro-dental affections.\n"

        "answer": "The educational programme of the degree course has been designed in coherence with the qualifying training objectives of Class L-32 and aims at providing the scientific and methodological bases to obtain a solid knowledge for a systemic approach to the world of nature, seen in its biotic and abiotic components, in their relations, and in their historical development. The degree program provides two educational paths, the first of which aimed at developing skills in the natural sciences sector, especially through the deepening of the \"biological disciplines\", and the second providing knowledge and skills in the field of environmental sciences through the deepening of the \"agricultural, chemical, physical, juridical, economic and contextual disciplines\". This possibility of deepening the two different thematic aspects justifies the wide range of credits in the areas of \"Biological Disciplines\" and \"Agricultural, Chemical, Physical, Legal, Economic and Contextual Disciplines\".\nTherefore, the formulation of the educational proposal entails the possibility of introducing further scientific-disciplinary sectors for class-specific activities, to provide a broader training offer that takes into account, above all, the right balance between the disciplines belonging to the biological sciences and earth sciences sectors. In the implementation of the cultural project it was decided to ensure a wide degree of freedom to the possibility of activating teachings in the sectors mentioned above, which are strategic to the degree project. This led to a wide range of credits for the basic and characterizing training activities, which may allow, in the preparation of the course syllabus, a more adequate adherence to the expected learning outcomes and to the available resources. The course includes from 39 to 66  credits for basic activities, to provide students with the solid scientific knowledge on which to set the specific study. The class specific activities are awarded with 54 to 102 CFU, with a substantial balance between the chemical, biological, ecological and Earth sciences disciplines, the cultural areas for graduates of this course, and a space for other disciplines completing the specific cultural training. The wide range of related and supplementary disciplines (from 18 to 30 CFU), integrates the acquired skills, even emphasizing disciplines already included among the class specific ones, for the specificity of the educational offer and of the relevant territorial context.\nFinally, ample space is dedicated to other training activities (from 27 to 39 CFU), such as multidisciplinary excursions, internships, traineeships and other activities oriented towards entering the labour market, as well as stays at other Italian and European universities, under international agreements. In order to achieve the learning outcomes, the educational programme provides a good knowledge of the foundations of mathematics, physics and chemistry, also through the acquisition of the relevant basic languages. This basic knowledge will allow to address, through the application of the scientific method: the study of the forms, phenomena and processes of animal and plant organisms, also at an evolutionary level; knowledge of the Earth system, through the study of endogenous and exogenous processes; the understanding of the interdisciplinary aspects of studies on nature and the environment. Through exercises, laboratories and internship activities, students will acquire the ability to collect, analyse and process field and laboratory data; to learn experimental protocols and procedures, to apply and communicate them; to acquire the ability to apply appropriate safety and preventions measures in the laboratory and in the field.\nGraduates of this course will therefore have acquired the scientific and methodological foundations enabling them to carry out professional activities, at an intermediate level of responsibility, in the various fields of natural and environmental sciences as support for the activities of control, management, recovery and planning of natural and anthropized environmental systems, as well as for activities of dissemination and scientific communication; they will also be able to effectively use, in written and oral form, at least one European Union language, within the specific area of competence.\n"

Knowledge of evolution and taxonomic diversity; 2. Characterisation of environment and natural biological resources; 3. determination of molecular and genetic markers for the taxonomic identification, phylogenesis and adaptive responses: 4. Naturalistic and educational dissemination of biological disciplines.\nThe always more widespread need for a renewed relationship between man and nature, aware of the need to integrate the knowledge and protection of biodiversity and natural systems with anthropic activities, at local and global level, requires professional skills aiming above all at understanding the biological mechanisms by which with which living organisms settle and evolve, adapting or not, in their environment.\nThe educational programme therefore includes the study of animal and plant biodiversity, of the structural and functional adaptations related to development and reproduction, of behavioural adaptations, of the interactions between organisms/populations and the environment.\nThe integrated and comparative approach provides for the knowledge of modern methods of analysis, in the field and in the laboratory, which find application and completion in the choice and implementation of the experimental thesis.\nThe educational programme and the development of the thesis are supported by training internships in the field and/or in the laboratory, by attendance in qualified research laboratories and by internships aimed at acquiring technical and relational skills useful for fitting in the field of applied research and in the labour market. Specific objectives, in this regard, are the activities related to environmental management, to the techniques of characterization and enhancement of biological resources, also in terms of innovative products, to naturalistic museology and in general to the knowledge and protection of the natural heritage.\nThe course is also structured in relation to the scientific and professional activities carried out at the site, with particular reference to applications in the Mediterranean area, and enables graduates to work independently, also assuming roles of responsibility for projects, facility and staff management. In addition, the 2nd cycle Degree enable the continuation towards higher education through PhD courses.\nThe programme includes:\n- the completion of the training in zoology and botany under a taxonomic and bio-molecular perspective;\n-the completion and deepening of the study of the biological evolution mechanisms also with reference to the genetic structure;\n- knowledge of the most modern methods of analysing biodiversity, natural ecosystems and products of biological origin, also as a function of human-environment interactions;\n- knowledge of methods for environmental monitoring and conservation of biodiversity;\n- the study of ecophysiological and adaptive responses at the level of organisms, populations, species and communities;\n- the study of biogeography;\n- knowledge of regulatory and legal traits in terms of environmental management and sustainability.\nThe learning and acquisition of professional skills is measured in credits, in accordance with the provisions of the University Educational Regulations.\nClasses are held in two semesters and consist of lectures, practical and/or field exercises.\nStudents will have to complete an internship period at research institutions or companies affiliated with the University of Palermo, which may also be aimed at the preparation of the thesis. The structure and articulation of each teaching and of the other educational activities are specified annually in the Degree Course Regulations.

Graduates in MED-IT will thus be able to face, analyse and solve medical-biological problems with innovative methodologies.\nIn accordance with this objective, the MED-IT Degree Course is characterised by a balanced vertical and cross integration among:\na)\tBasic sciences, with a wide spectrum, including the knowledge of evolutionary biology, molecular biology, genetics, and biological complexity. This study aims at acquiring the knowledge of the structure and function of the human organism, in normal conditions, in order to maintain health conditions and to correctly apply the translational scientific research. Among basic sciences, a crucial role is played by subjects such as calculus, physics, chemistry, computer science, and statistics.\nb)\tThe knowledge of pathological processes and of the mechanisms that cause them, with specific attention to individual variability and to gender differences, in order also to define prevention, diagnosis and treatment in a targeted manner; under this perspective, the knowledge of the role played by lifestyle, nutrition, and physical activity in the acquisition and maintenance of health status and in the approach to pathologies is also crucial.\nc)\tThe clinical and methodological medical practice, which must be particularly solid, based on the extensive use of tutorial-professional teaching.\nd)\tHuman sciences, which should be a useful tool to achieve the awareness of being a medical doctor and of the values of the medical profession, and the ethics in doctor-patient relationship. \ne)\tThe acquisition of evidence-based scientific, medical, clinical, and professional methodology for individual or collective health issues, with specific attention to the differences among populations and to gender differences, to rare diseases and to the development of new approaches enabling a growing effectiveness of medical care as well as of palliative care and pain therapy.\nf)\tThe technologies used in the medical field, necessary for an effective and safe use of equipment and plants, as well as for the training of health technicians and staff. Crucial for this knowledge is the study of computer science, bioinformatics, electromagnetism, electro-technique and applied electronics, automation, sensors and measurements, biomechanics, solid and fluid mechanics for biological systems, as well as basic notions of signal and image processing, neuroscience, as well as the concepts of biocompatibility, regenerative medicine, micro drug delivery and tissue engineering.\ng)\tThe always more complex biomedical equipment and plants, aiming at the diagnosis and care of patients, as well as the fundamentals of the most modern biomedical engineering issues.\nIn synthesis: MED-IT graduates must be able to obtain information by the patient and to interpret them, to make clinical decisions guiding to a correct diagnosis and targeted therapeutic interventions, but also and above all, through the expert use of technologies, to which they have given their contribution during the specific application development. Their decisions must be deduced through the best clinical practices, the correct application of technology and scientific evidence, without forgetting the patient\u2019s needs and of the Healthcare systems of the Country in which they operate. Their clinical practice must be therefore based upon updated knowledge and must be ethical and capable of ensuring an efficient use of the available resources; furthermore, it must be carried out in strict \u201ccooperation-sharing\u201d with the patients and their families and with the other members of the intra-professional/inter-professional work team.\nThanks to the contribution of teachings in the biomedical engineering area, graduates will also be able to solve methodological and technological problems in the physiological and clinical fields, to carry out the analysis and modelling of bio signals and bioimages, medical robotics and computational biomechanics, and to use the relevant medical software supporting diagnostics.\nAn integral part of the educational programme consists of:\n-\tProfessional/qualifying internship, both at the University Hospital and at various local accredited healthcare facilities and hospitals, as well as in the general practitioner clinics accredited by the University, in collaboration with the Province Boards of Medical Doctors, Surgeons and Dentists.\n-\tThe mandatory optional educational activities (ADO), allowing the integration of training with the study of subjects related to other areas (both medical and scientific-engineering ones) and with the acquisition of soft skills and knowledge useful for post-graduate training and for placement.\nThe Course aims at providing a solid educational structure, and stakeholders have agreed upon the usefulness of the professional functions and skills acquired by MED-IT graduates; stakeholders are actively involved in the development process of this Degree Course with respect not only to the educational aspects, but also to the issues related to graduates\u2019 know-how. The opinion of the consulted organisations is seen as very important in this project, aiming at the training of the Medical Doctor with the above-described skills. This with a view to preparing graduates with a profile immediately spendable in the labour market and, at the same time, with solid groundings for any continuation in higher level education.\n"

In relation to the needs of the context and of the potential catchment area, identified during the meeting with the stakeholders, the training of the graduate in \"Architecture and project in built space\" is mainly addressed to the intervention on the built/natural environment after the identification of the relevant problems. In this sense, the course proposes not only to the Agrigento area, but also at national level, an educational programme modelled according to the socially shared needs representing the current areas of commitment and employment for junior architects/engineers. Graduates will be able to understand all the issues related to the requalification of building systems, with respect, in particular, to eco-compatibility and energy saving, re-use and re-conversion of buildings, restoration of historical buildings, re-design of civil artefacts and urban environment affected by abandonment and lacking in formal quality.\nGraduates must therefore acquire mature historical-critical awareness, judgment ability and correct formal sensibility towards the quality of built space; knowledge of survey and representation tools, of traditional and innovative techniques and materials, namely reusable and low-impact ones; of building components, even industrial ones; of the behaviour of structures, in seismic risk conditions too; of the building and managerial processes; of the processes of alteration of materials and structures; of urban planning and urban planning technique; of the social phenomena related to the urban environment and their dynamics.\nThe acquired knowledge and skills will find their synthesis and verification in the project, in which graduates should be able to understand the relevant methodological aspects and operational phases. A specific trait of the three-year course id the attention to the culture of project, at all feasibility levels: technical feasibility, through the knowledge of structures; economic feasibility, through valuation related subjects; environmental feasibility, through a strong orientation towards sustainable environmental design, to the study of environmental control techniques and innovative technologies; administrative feasibility, through the internship at Public Administrations and Local Authorities. \nThe course therefore prepares students to face the following issues: building requalification, maintenance, recovery (of buildings as well as of built space), the safety of yards and buildings, the amelioration and seismic retrofitting, the energy control and the improvement of physical-technical performance, the innovation of technology, plants and materials. With respect to these issues, the course provides specific skills in relation to: the analysis of the relation between project and building; the support activities for architectural technological, structural, urban design; the organisation and management of building yards; the economic evaluation of production processes; the instruments of local governance. The educational programme provides 180 credits, including the final examination, with 81 credits (36 for basic activities and 45 for class-specific subjects) satisfying the requirements of class L-23, according to Ministerial Decree 270. The course also satisfies the requirements in terms of essential educational activities for class L-17 (Architectural Science), equal to 180 credits, such as to enable graduates to enrol, without needing to acquire more credits, to the 2nd cycle degree class LM-4 Architecture and Building Engineering-Architecture.\nThe proposed teachings include basic subjects, such as Mathematics, History of Architecture and Town, Architectural and Environmental Survey and Representation, as well as class-specific subjects, such as Construction Technology, Materials and Structural Engineering, Technical Physics, Architectural Design, Urban Planning and Technique, Restoration, Land and Building Valuation.

The degree course, through its educational activities, has its central nucleus in the architectural project at various scales, from the object, to the building, the town, the region; the project, which is carried out as a process, taking also advantage of its own procedures, constitutes an instrument of knowledge and experiential-scientific activity, which has as its object the physical reality in view of its useful and necessary modification to the life and living of man and the needs of associated life.\n2nd cycle graduates in architecture must be able to design, at various scales, using the tools of architecture, including those of planning sciences, and must possess the skills to verify the feasibility of the project, the operations of construction of the works, of transformation and modification of the natural and artificial physical environment, with full awareness of the aesthetic, distributive, functional, structural, technical-constructive, infrastructural, managerial, geographical, economic and environmental aspects and with critical attention to cultural changes and to the needs expressed by the contemporary society.\nThe educational objectives aim at favouring the acquisition of the knowledge, skills and competences necessary for an architect to face the main current and future project challenges, with a view to a transformation and management of the built environment providing adequate, conscious and sustainable responses to the contemporary society.\nAt the end of the two-year course and through the exams, student must demonstrate their ability to achieve executive design syntheses in the fields of architectural and urban design, urban planning, construction of architecture, restoration of monuments: they must be able to produce specific thematic and disciplinary in-depth studies in view of the degree thesis.\nA part of the training is oriented towards learning and knowledge of theories, methods, and disciplines; another theoretical-practical part of the training is oriented towards learning and practicing their \"know-how\" in the instrumental and specific professional activities. Theoretical-practical activities are carried out in the laboratories, that have as their purpose the description of the physical and architectural reality, and the knowledge, understanding and practice of the project. Attendance to the laboratories is mandatory, and it is ascertained by the teacher in charge. To ensure appropriate teaching assistance, also in accordance with the EEC Recommendation, referred to in point 1, paragraph 2, in the laboratories a personalized relationship must be ensured between the teacher and the learners such as to allow individual control of the project practice; therefore, no more than 50 students can be admitted to each laboratory.\nLaboratories: Integrated Course \u201cLaboratory of Survey and project of the built environment\u201d, \u201cLaboratory of Urban planning for the ecological city\u201d, \u201cLaboratory of Building Rehabilitation\u201d and the integrated course \u201cLaboratory of Restoration and Architectural Design in the built environment\u201d; students can also choose one of the two optional laboratories: \u201cLaboratory of Conservation and Consolidation of buildings\u201d or \u201cLaboratory of Sustainable Living Design\u201d \nThe Laboratories may be structured in modules and integrate more disciplinary area.

The course is therefore carried out through frontal teachings, laboratory activities, seminars, internships and professional training, activities conducted remotely (smart working, project work and the like) embracing several scientific branches and can also take place abroad, thus providing awareness of employment contexts and professions guiding the choice of future study and work commitments. Mandatory internships in companies, organizations or research or service centres enable students to put in practice the acquired skills.\nThe course is therefore divided into the following main areas:\na) IT area, in which the study of the different computer programming languages is addressed, from the latest native version Python interpreter, with Idle integrated to one of the Content Management Systems such as WordPress or Joomla locally via the Xampp platform, aiming at providing students a secure mastery of computer programming languages for cultural production and to make them capable of managing the operating system in its basic functions and the software application packages in the installation, recovery and use of files phases.\nb) Linguistic-literary area in which the study of themes and forms of Italian literature and contemporary Italian literature is addressed with exemplary insights into movements, poetics, authors and the analysis of texts and the main critical interpretations. From the perspective of humanistic information technology, the main existing digital resources for study and research in the field of the discipline are illustrated aiming to enable students to make use of them profitably. A specific role is played by the study of textual forms of the twentieth-century tradition and their new configurations in the 'digital revolution', envisaging the unprecedented frontier of file philology. The objective is to enable students to use the methodologies of critical, linguistic, and philological analysis at an advanced level and to create digital critical editions using IT tools. In the linguistic field, the study of the notions of 'hypotextuality' and 'fragmentation' and the acquisition of the tools to create the contents of digital storytelling will be addressed with the aim of knowing how to orchestrate the various declinations (timeline, story mapping, trans-media storytelling, visual and video storytelling). It will be accompanied by the study of the principles of distributional linguistics, neural networks, embeddings, deep learning, up to the analysis of current Large Language Models or computational linguistic models with the aim of framing problems that can be treated with Big Data (extraction of information from texts, automatic response to questions, chat bots) and to solve them through the design and development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions.\nd) Historical field, in which the historical, political and theoretical context in which - in the contemporary age - public opinion was born, developed and transformed is studied in order to enable students to recognize the different concepts of public opinion by placing them in relation to the various historical phases in which they appeared, identifying the lines of continuity and fracture and consciously orienting themselves within today's public sphere, characterized on a global scale by the crisis of democracy and the pervasiveness of new media.\ne) Legal field, in which the study of the rules and fundamental principles of digital law is addressed, to enable students to orient themselves in the system of this discipline and to master its interpretative tools.\nf) Field of archival and artistic disciplines, related to the study of basic or complex digital environments (big data), of the transformations and impacts that the network has on the way of interacting and managing, as well as of the museological development from the second half of the twentieth century to date, in relation to museums, galleries and art archives in Western Europe and North America.\nThe objective is to enable students to set up and create databases and digital archives, enhance the cultural heritage of Libraries, Archives, Museums and coordinate digital activities in Schools and in the Public Administration. This disciplinary area also deals with the study of the manipulation and reuse of images in different media contexts, as well as the dynamics of transition of audio-visual objects among different media, in order to put students in the conditions to handle an integrated digital ecosystem.\ng) Philosophical-pedagogical field, focused on the study of perceptual structures that can be translated into parameters for communication with new media, of the relationship between language and communication in the digital age, of the extensions of digital teaching to the world of edutainment and serious games. The objective is to enable students to use digital languages and metalanguages professionally in the elaboration and processing of texts and other cultural objects.\nA digital publishing workshop is functional to provide basic and advanced skills in digital processing textual contents intended for publication. In particular, the steps of the main editorial workflow models are formalized and analysed in their digital version as well as in the execution of their specific objectives. The aim is to accompany students, through all the steps, in the design and creation of a digital editorial content.\nThe educational path provides for the preparatory study of the Fundamentals of Computer Science and Programming, combined with a first group of class-specific and related disciplines , providing knowledge of digital law (of information technology, the web, the network ), of the notions and functional tools to create the contents of digital storytelling and digital publishing in all its phases (from design to implementation), of the principles of distributional linguistics, neural networks. At the same time, students can start structuring their own preparation through the study of digital teaching linked to the world of educational games and the contribution, according to an individual choice, of optional related subjects such as Italian literature, archiving and museology, in order to allow the acquisition of skills that can be used in various professional fields.\nBased on the knowledge acquired, the course proceeds with the advanced study of other computer science disciplines and of one of the significant applications of computer science to literary analysis, the study of digital philology applied to the texts of contemporary writers which can be supported in the context of related disciplines. an extension on themes and forms of contemporary Italian literature. This fruitful interdisciplinary interweaving is enriched by the proposal of a variety of teachings aimed at deepening and broadening the digital horizon and its effects in the fields of history, cinema, communication, aesthetics, and Italian literature. Lastly, further training opportunities are offered by web-based internship activities (in companies, bodies, public administrations allowing the application of digital technology in the various disciplines and in the various professional fields) and, on the internationalization side, by the Erasmus mobility programme,  as part of the agreements with European universities including the University of Louvain (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) where an advanced Master's degree in Digital Humanities is active and the Niccol\u00f2 Copernico University of Torun.\nAt the end of the two-year period, the student presents as a final test a report which has as its object a research in the digital humanities area, which can also be connected to the activity carried out as an internship in cultural centers and companies. The work must demonstrate command of IT tools, mastery of the topics addressed, critical, expository, and independent judgement skills. LM-43 graduates will be therefore able to further develop their skills through new digital and research tools in the context of different professional contexts.\nThe criteria and methods for drafting the degree thesis will be detailed in the Educational Regulations.\n"

The second teaching, Aromatic and medicinal plants in gastronomy (6 CFU), aiming to illustrate the importance of these plant species in gastronomy. The third elective teaching, Food and Religions (3 CFU) aims at explaining the role of food in different religions. The fourth course, Local Food and Wine Promotion Strategies (3 CFU) provides students with the link between food and wine and local development.\nEach course credit consists of 10 hours of assisted teaching activities (70% frontal teaching and 30% exercises, laboratory activities and technical visits).\nThe acquired knowledge, skills and competences will enable students to develop the self-learning and continuous updating abilities, through the consultation of scientific publications in the sector and to attend both first-level master university Master courses and 2nd cycle degree courses.\nThe teachings follow a specific order, to provide the student with a logical sequence of knowledge and skills that can be acquired. Each year is divided into two semesters.\nThe coordination of integrated courses is carried out with particular attention to the case of integrated courses including disciplines belonging to different scientific-disciplinary sectors. These teachings will be activated to complete the student's training in compliance with scientific, cultural and professional affinities and with full integration of the adopted teaching methods.\nThe fragmentation of teaching activities, in compliance with the university education regulations, was in any case limited to only 6 teachings.\nThe educational regulations of the Degree course will indicate recommended propaedeutics in compliance with the orderly and sequential acquisition of knowledge and skills.\n"

        "answer": "The objective of the single-cycle Degree Course  in Architecture, class LM 4, is the training of  professionals with specific competences in the field of architecture in compliance with the provisions of the EEC directive 85/384. The course, through the teachings, has its central nucleus in the architectural project on the various scales, from the object to the building, the city, the territory: the project, therefore,  constitutes an instrument of knowledge and experiential-scientific activity, which has as its object the physical reality in view of its useful and necessary modification to the life and living of man and to the demands of society life. The corpus of the discipline, with its own principles and norms, constitutes the foundation and orientation of project activities, on the basis of its specific statute, in which the experience of architecture over time constitutes the reference for every theorization and subsequent experience. Consequently, and specifically, graduates of this course must be able to govern the processes of the project and identify the extent of its interference; they must also know in depth the history of architecture, the tools and forms of representation, the theoretical-scientific, methodological and operational aspects of mathematics and other basic sciences, and be able to use this knowledge to interpret and describe thoroughly even complex architectural problems, including the ones requiring interdisciplinary skills; finally, they must have knowledge in the field of building organization and corporate culture, in the light of their own professional ethics. \nGraduates in Architecture must be able to design, at various scales, through typical architectural tools, including plan sciences, and must possess the skills to verify the feasibility of the project, the operations of construction of works, transformation and modification of the natural and artificial physical environment, with full knowledge of aesthetic, distributional, functional, structural, technical-constructive, infrastructural, managerial, geographical, economic and environmental aspects and with critical attention to cultural changes and to the needs expressed by contemporary society. In addition to the preparation of architectural projects, graduates directs their implementation, coordinating for these purposes and where necessary other specialists and operators in the fields of architecture, construction engineering, urban planning, restoration and of the conservation of architecture. In this regard, the universities organize external activities such as internships and stages.\nThe educational programme is divided into two cycles. The first three-year cycle is dedicated to humanistic, scientific and technological training. Students, at the end of the first cycle, must demonstrate to have learned the fundamentals of the logic of architecture, of its constitution, of the history of the essential components of the architectural and urban space, as well as the fundamental architectural representation techniques as well as subjects preparatory to the technical control of the project; they must be able to reach a first synthesis of the project in its aesthetic, technical and functional aspects. \nThe second cycle, of two years, completing the programme, ends with the degree examination, and aims at specific professional insights. Students, at the end of the cycle and through the exams, must demonstrate their ability to reach executive design syntheses in the fields of architectural and urban design, town planning, architecture construction, monument restoration; they must know how to produce specific thematic and disciplinary investigations in view of the degree thesis. \nA part of the programme provides the knowledge of theories, methods and disciplines; another theoretical-practical part of the training provides practical know-how in the instrumental and specific professional activities. \nTheoretical-practical activities take place in the laboratories, educational structures aiming at describing the physical and architectural reality, and at providing the knowledge, understanding and implementation of the project. Attendance is mandatory and is verified by the professor in charge of the laboratory. A personalized relationship between the teacher and the learner must be ensured in the laboratories, according to the provisions of the EEC Recommendation, to allow individual control of the project practice; therefore, each laboratory is attended by a maximum of 50 students. The Laboratories are: Architectural Design Laboratory, Architecture Construction Laboratory, Urban Planning Laboratory, Monument Restoration Laboratory, and other laboratories identified from time to time in the Course outline in the fields of Design, Interior Architecture in its various aspects, and others involving project activities at different scales. The laboratories might be divided into modules related to various disciplines, either in the same disciplinary area or in different disciplinary areas. Some teaching activities might also take place at qualified scientific research institutes as well as research and development departments of public and private institutions and companies operating in the Architecture, Civil Engineering and Urban Planning sectors, subject to stipulation of specific conventions that may also include the use of experts belonging to these structures and institutions, for special educational activities (intensive courses, seminars, internships).\n"

        "answer": "The single-cycle degree course consists of a total of 360 university credits (ECTS), spread over six years. Each credit corresponds to a student commitment of 25 hours, of which normally no more than 10 hours of frontal teaching. Each professional credit corresponds to 25 hours of work per student, of which at least 20 hours of professional educational activity, carried out in small groups at the educational facilities of the Degree Course or other structures of the territorial NHS in agreement.\nSpecific importance, as an integral and qualifying part of professional training, is held by the professionalizing training activity of internship prodromal to the achievement of the qualifying academic degree.\nWithin the 60 C.F.U. of professional training activity, 15 credits are envisaged intended for carrying out the three-month practical-evaluative internship referred to in article 3 of the decree of the Minister of Education, University and Research dated 9 May 2018, n. 58 and subsequent amendments, aimed at obtaining professional qualification. Each month of this internship consists of a number of hours corresponding to at least 5 credits. The internship is divided into the following periods, even if not consecutive: one month in the Surgical Area; one month in the Medical Area; one month, to be carried out during the sixth year of the course, in the specific field of General Medicine.\nEach credit of the internship corresponds to at least 20 hours of professionalizing teaching activity and no more than 5 hours of individual study.\nPursuant to article 102, paragraph 1, of decree law no. 18/2020, the final exam of single-cycle degree of the LM-41 class in Medicine and Surgery has the value of a national qualification exam, after passing the practical evaluation internship, as per the decree of the Minister of Education, University and of the research 9 May 2018, n. 58.\nGraduates of the class must achieve the skills required by the specific professional profile.\nSPECIFIC MISSION OF THE SINGLE-CYCLE DEGREE COURSE.\nThe biomedical psycho-social mission of the single-cycle degree course aims at the real development of professional competence as well as of the values of professionalism. It is founded on the importance of integrating the biomedical paradigm of \"treating the disease\" with the psychosocial paradigm of \"taking care of the human being\" in the metaparadigm of the \"complexity of care\".\nThis specific mission aims therefore at training a doctor, at an initial professional level, providing:\n\u2022 a multidisciplinary, interprofessional and integrated vision of the most common health and disease problems;\n\u2022 an education oriented towards the prevention of disease and the promotion of health within the community and the territory;\n\u2022 a deep knowledge of the new needs of care and health, cantered not only on the disease, but, above all, on the ill person, considered in his totality of soma and psyche and inserted in a specific social context;\nTHE SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL PROJECT, THE TEACHING METHOD\nThe teaching method, useful for achieving the expected qualifying traits, provides for the horizontal and vertical integration of knowledge; it is a teaching method based on a solid cultural and methodological basis achieved in the study of pre-clinical disciplines and subsequently mainly focused on the ability to solve problems and make decisions, on the early contact with the patient, on the acquisition of good clinical skills combined with the ability to have a human relationship with the patient.\nThe teaching plan proposes the right balance of vertical and transversal integration among:\na) The basic sciences at large, including the knowledge of evolutionary biology, molecular biology and genetics and biological complexity aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human organism under normal conditions, for the purpose of maintaining the conditions of health and the correct application of translational scientific research;\nb) Knowledge of morbid processes and the mechanisms that cause them, also in order to set up prevention, diagnosis and therapy;\nc) Clinical and methodological medical practice, through the extensive use of tutorial-type teaching, capable of transforming theoretical knowledge into personal experience in order to build one's own scale of values and interests, and to provide the professional skills useful for knowing how to manage the complexity of medicine;\nd) Human sciences, constituting a useful baggage to reach the awareness of being a doctor and of the profound values of the doctor's profession;\ne) The acquisition of scientific, medical, clinical, and professional methodology aiming at individual and community health problems, with due attention to population and sex/gender differences.\nA solid foundation of clinical knowledge is also ensured to the student through the organization of certified internships based on tutorial teaching, together with a strong understanding of the medical-scientific method and the human sciences. True professional competence, to be achieved after long contact with the patient, will be promoted from the first year, also through training in simulation, and integrated, throughout the course, with basic and clinical sciences through extensive use of tutored activities.\nThe expected learning outcomes are defined by integrating the European Descriptors (5 Dublin descriptors) with the proposal of the Institute for International Medical Education (IIME), Task Force for Assessment, and by \u201cThe TUNING Project (Medicine) \u2013 Learning Outcomes/ Competences for Undergraduate Medical Education in Europe\u201d.\nThe learning objectives for the Single Cycle Degree Courses in Medicine and Surgery are attributed to the different methodological skills envisaged by the DM 16/03/2007, art. 3 paragraph 7 required for this Graduate. The objectives are also consistent with what is indicated by the \"Core curriculum for the Degree in Medicine and Surgery\" proposed by the Permanent Conference of the Presidents of the Italian Degree Courses in Medicine.\n"

        "answer": "The educational path of the degree course provides the scientific and methodological bases for a systemic approach towards biodiversity as well as socio-environmental problems and for the analysis of process components, related to the natural environment and modified by anthropogenic actions.\nThe training project, pays particular attention to ensuring that students meet, from the first year, all the mathematics, physics, chemistry, earth sciences, biology, law, economics and medicine disciplines. This will favour an aptitude for trans-disciplinary approach and problem solving in a holistic key. The courses themselves, where possible, will be characterized by trans-disciplinary paths with the co-presence of teachers belonging to different scientific areas.\nThe degree course aims to provide a professional training which, thanks to the heterogeneity of the methodological aspects and basic knowledge, enables graduates to directly access the job market as well as to continue in subsequent study paths.\nSPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES\nThe degree course aims to train professionals capable of:\n-Monitoring and increasing knowledge related to biodiversity heritage and mapping distribution, value, and peculiarity in ecosystems.\n- Knowing how to read the biological complexity and the relationships among organisms to define tools to support functional biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a One-health context including ecosystem and human health.\n- Operating to promote the economic, social and environmental value of biodiversity also thanks to circular economy and restoration economy processes.\n-Knowing the technologies, namely Key Enabling Technologies (biotechnologies, artificial intelligence and digitization, technologies for life sciences) to enhance and restore biodiversity based on the design of new early warning technologies and forecasting models\n- Operating in the field of biodiversity by proposing new observation tools and detection technology integrated in a science support system for political actions (conservation, restoration, reclamation, recovery, ecosystem services, valorisation, health, etc.) and innovation from micro to macro-scale.\nIn short, the three-year course includes:\n- basic teachings, with mandatory courses in: mathematics/statistics, chemistry and physics which provide the basis for the analysis of natural phenomena;\n- class-specific and related educational activities in the biological, ecological, geological and engineering fields to understand the biological complexity and to identify solutions with high technological value for a sustainable management of biodiversity ensuring the resilience of ecosystems.\n- class-specific activities, providing economic-legal skills for the use of tools applied on the territory that lead to economic savings, lower impacts and the maintenance of ecosystem functions.\n- related activities, concerning the assessment of biodiversity interconnections which are gradually introduced as part of the One Health network.\nThe training course includes several credits in basic activities (from 36 to 60 credits), to provide students with a solid scientific knowledge on which to set up the specific study. From 66 to 96 credits are dedicated to the class-specific activities, with a substantial balance among the biological, ecological, earth sciences and agricultural, chemical, physical, legal, economic and context disciplines, which represent the cultural fields in which BIT graduates operate. Other disciplines complete the characterizing cultural education. The wide range of related and integrative disciplines (from 18 to 33 credits) provides a sufficiently articulated spectrum to allow integration with the characterizing skills acquired, also emphasizing disciplines already included among the characterizing ones, due to the specificities of the proposed training offer and of the local context in which it is located. Finally, ample space is dedicated to other training activities (from 27 to 48 credits), with excursions, internships, apprenticeships and other activities in any case oriented towards entering the job market, as well as stays at other Italian and European universities, also within the framework of international agreements.\nSpecifically, students in Biodiversity and technological innovation will develop knowledge of the fundamentals of mathematics, physics, statistics, chemistry, biology, geology, oceanography and ecology in the course of the first year and part of the second, providing the basic languages of individual disciplines and the scientific method, the analysis of natural phenomena and of the parts of systemic biomonitoring.\nDuring the second and third year, students may also acquire knowledge in class-specific and related activities in the biological, ecological, geological, and engineering field for:\n-\tThe definition of natural ecosystems with respect to their composition, to their chemical, ecological, geochemical, geomorphological and biochemical traits, as well as to the various levels of animal and vegetal biodiversity.\n-\tThe knowledge and understanding of the basic tools to use for studying natural and environmental processes and their relationship with climate changes and anthropogenic impact.\nDuring the second year, class-specific teachings in the economic-juridical field provide the knowledge to interpret sustainable development issues under different perspectives (scientific, economic-juridical, and health-related) through the study of the causes and effects of climate changes related to economics and environmental law.\nConsistently with the specific course objectives, the class-specific activities of the second and third year in the naturalistic and economic field, as well as the related activities (agricultural, medical, engineering fields) will enable students to understand the complex mechanisms which connect nature and biodiversity on the one hand and human health on the other and which can lead to benefits and risks for communities exposed to ever stronger environmental drivers based on the competencies of health issues.\nAs a further strong point of the course, an innovative teaching approach is therefore proposed, characterized by:\n- Multidisciplinary paths: ability to analyse ecological socio-systems and to manage issues related to the ecosystem with an interdisciplinary perspective, exploiting the skills and research acquired during the entire training course in an integrated way.\n-Integration of courses addressing the issues of sustainable development from different points of view, (scientific, economic, legal and health-related): climate change, biodiversity, environmental impact assessment, development law and economics, territorial planning and health.\nGraduates will therefore be able to:\n- Participate in intervention programs for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity through the design of new early warning technologies and the definition of tools to support functional biodiversity and ecosystem resilience based on Key Enabling Technologies, thanks to the skills acquired in the biological, ecological, earth sciences, chemical and engineering learning areas.\n-Study the mechanisms capable of reducing the operating costs of biodiversity, identifying processes to exploit raw materials of biological origin and residual biomass to replace high-impact productions, thanks to the skills acquired in the biological/ecological/agricultural learning areas\n- Conduct collaborative activities with local administrations, public bodies (public administrations, Arpa, Department, Ministry, trade unions, etc.) and private companies aimed at environmental monitoring in its abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems, thanks to the skills acquired in the biological, ecological, earth sciences, chemical, and engineering learning areas.\n-Integrate and promote synergies among groups of companies and between the public and private sectors in the context of sustainable production and consumption, identifying the tools applied on the territory which lead to economic savings, lower impacts and the maintenance of ecosystem functions thanks to the skills acquired in the scientific and economic-legal field\n"

        "answer": "Specific objectives:\nThe main objective of the course is to provide graduates with a solid preparation concerning the development of processes and products for industrial production and advanced craftsmanship, forms of communication and innovative services, starting from the design culture and specific design methodologies.\nEducational programme\nThe programme is designed to dialogue with the evolutionary scenarios relating to the material and immaterial resources present in the territory, training designers able to contribute positively to the identification, valorisation and best use of these resources in the economic and socio-cultural development processes expressing innovation, with particular reference to the various productive and entrepreneurial aspects relating to the agri-food sector, therefore to the cultural and productive peculiarities of the contexts expressing its excellence, with a view to sustainability.\nThe degree course develops the skills and competences of an expert designer oriented towards the valorisation of territorial resources and the opportunities and potential offered by the increasingly pervasive technologies and digital culture; with a specific attention to the socio-cultural and productive and entrepreneurial dynamics of to-date food production, as an expression of territorial excellence and identity, but also of user awareness paths in the processes of sustainability and social innovation. The proposed professional and scientific profile fits fully into that potential for development and innovation of territorial production systems (particularly in the Mediterranean areas) expressed by the agri-food sector and by the areas, even closely connected, of production of goods and services, such as tourism, hospitality and cultural production, care and valorisation of the environment and communities.\nDesigners must develop the ability to collaborate with different professionals in the development of complex strategic design processes aimed at articulating innovative production of goods, integrated and advanced communication products, technological services for sales proposals and responsible use of cultural products and offers, even in traditional production contexts proposing themselves for the quality of their territorial productions in broader or global contexts.\nThe educational objective of the Degree Course consists in:\n- providing methodological design tools for the valorisation and implementation of productions and activities that are an expression of a territory and its cultural identity, also interpreting new needs and opportunities not yet expressed by territorial stakeholders; the used methodologies will experiment with innovation processes in all phases of the project, from research to conception, from engineering to technical and environmental control of production processes, to the introduction of the product into market dynamics, to the social and cultural implications;\n- providing disciplinary and interdisciplinary knowledge to develop the ability to interact in complex and evolving territorial and sectoral contexts; also through the organization of work groups and design processes that explore the complexity of development scenarios, social and environmental sustainability and develop specific strategies for production, communication and integrated services, enhancing multidisciplinary contributions and exploring the dynamics of multiculturalism;\n- preparing professional designers with a strong humanistic component, creativity and technical ability to manage the design of artefacts and systems for setting up public spaces, together with advanced communication processes (interactive, digital, multimedia and intermedial) rich in narrative elements aimed at highlighting and interpreting, with contemporary tools and languages, the identity aspects, including immaterial ones, of the territory.\n- experimenting complex sustainability processes, also based on the enhancement and reactivation of complete supply chains in territorial production, especially centred on food production; thus, developing the skills for analysis and research on project experiences and interdisciplinary sharing, within scenarios that reflect the issues of the necessary ecological and digital transition of Made in Italy productions;\n- developing self-entrepreneurship proposals calibrated on the potential of new products and new ways of enjoying traditional productions, also for the purpose of qualitatively expanding the tourist offer integrated with the various aspects of hospitality, catering, enjoyment of cultural and environmental assets, also through e-commerce and social media tools.\nEducational programme\nIn compliance with the indications provided by Ministerial Decree 270/2004, all thematic areas (design, scientific-technological, historical-humanistic, economic-productive) that contribute to the definition of the educational path identified by the course project are adequately represented through the contribution of professors from four Departments of the University of Palermo and defined in relation to the characterizing profiles of each discipline. Each subject or thematic area assumes a well-defined role within the student's educational path and with respect to its placement and development in the two-year period.\nThe Degree course organizes teaching mainly through disciplinary and interdisciplinary design workshops, integrated courses and individual teachings for specific in-depth study, providing for forms of collaboration with companies, for the development of projects and prototypes, strategies and innovative services. The workshops are distributed over the two-year period in a balanced manner with respect to the weight of the other subjects foreseen for each year of the course.\nThe training path is completed with differentiated activities (internship, conferences, seminars, workshops, and elective courses), enabling the integration of training through teachings related to other areas and the acquisition of knowledge and skills of context and sector, useful for entering the job market and for the development of new entrepreneurial proposals.\nIn the second year, a laboratory will be activated specifically aimed at developing innovative and strategic project proposals for the territory, also through the most advanced methodological approaches and technological tools; in the laboratory students, also with the support of other teachings, will be able to develop in a critical and interdisciplinary way their final project for the achievement of the 2nd cycle Degree in class LM-12. The course also aims to establish a close relationship among the final exam, the topics addressed, and the skills acquired through company internships, favouring the establishment of a concrete and non-episodic relationship with the productive fabric of the territory, but also with companies of national and international importance.\n"

Therefore, the practical experiences of the continuous and updated research of the teachers are poured into the teachings.\nThe Degree Course aims at training experts in the agro-engineering management of the rural territory and experts in the forest-wood system. The specific objective of the Degree Course is to develop the skills needed to face and manage complex problems, namely in: i) the precision management of agricultural production systems; ii) the use and management of water resources; iii) the territorial planning and analysis of production processes; iv) the management and conservation of forest ecosystems; v) the organization and enhancement of the forest-wood supply chain and biomass production; vi) the survey, representation and defence of the territory, the management and restoration of hydro-geological instability; vii) the organization and management of agro-forestry companies also in relation to the European Union guidelines for agro-environmental policies.\nThe inter-class 2nd cycle degree course in \"Agroengineering and Forestry Sciences and Technologies\" provides in the first year a common curricular path including teachings mainly in the economic-legal, production, forestry and environmental, defence, agricultural engineering fields. In the second year, the path is divided into two profiles, a first (class LM-69) mainly oriented towards the agro-engineering management of the territory and a second one (class LM-73) characterized by aspects linked to the forest-wood system. In particular, graduates acquire, through the Lm-69 path, specialist skills related to the design of agro-engineering works, the planning and management of the agro-forest territory with particular attention to the protection of natural resources, soil protection, to management through modern precision agriculture technologies. The issues related to the management and protection of the forest heritage, the enhancement of wood and non-wood products, the management of agro-forestry companies, the planning and management of the agro-forestry territory with particular attention to the protection of natural resources, the soil defence, are privileged in the LM-73 path.\nEducational activities consist of lectures, laboratory and field exercises, specialized seminars, and possible ongoing tests. To achieve the final qualification, students must have acquired 120 credits (CFU). Each frontal credit corresponds to 10 hours, while each CFU reserved for exercises, laboratory activities corresponds to 12 hours. The educational programme consists of 12 mandatory exams including elective activities, other training activities aimed at acquiring in-depth linguistic knowledge, as well as highly professional skills directly linked to the labour market, carried out in laboratory form (9 CFU). \nWith reference to these activities, it is worth specifying that the course includes activities related to the agricultural sector, to the agricultural industry, to precision agriculture technologies and to the defence from the main plant diseases, as well as to the forestry sector, with laboratory activities related to mycology, geomatics and reforestation techniques. The student's training is completed by a practical/applicative internship at accredited premises, such as Italian and foreign companies (through the Erasmus + Traineeship program), public and private agencies, professional firms, non-governmental organizations. The educational programme is completed by finally by the final exam related to specific topics addressed during the course.\nOn the basis of the choice made, at the end of the Course students can obtain the 2nd cycle Degree in \"Agroengineering and Forestry Sciences and Technologies\" in class LM-69 or in class LM-73, and after passing the relevant national qualification examination, they can register in section A of the professional register of the Board of Doctors of Agronomy and Forestry.\n"

        "answer": "Specific objectives:\nWithin an integrated path of historical-archaeological and historical-artistic cut, the Degree Course aims in particular at satisfying the need for functional professionalism in heritage education, in addition to the traditional areas of conservation, management and enhancement of cultural heritage, in the spirit of the so-called \"Faro Convention\", ratified by 20 member countries of the Council of Europe, including Italy, which has expressly brought the conscious enjoyment and sharing of cultural heritage back into the fold of the fundamental rights of the individual.\nThe objective is to further define and qualify the profiles of museum educator and operator of educational services of cultural sites, as well as of the teaching staff and future schoolteachers of historical-artistic and humanistic disciplines with targeted training, enhancing the indispensable advanced skills on archaeological and historical-artistic assets at the centre of heritage education actions.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the training project focuses on the specific subjects common to the two classes LM-2 and LM-89, with  some class-specific sectors of one class and related sectors of the other (or vice versa) providing the necessary completion of knowledge on the historical-cultural contexts, on the sources and on the technical and conservative, regulatory and financial aspects, ensuring a robust training in archaeological and artistic heritage disciplines which is essential for the quality and effectiveness of the graduates' activity; to this end, the aforementioned disciplinary training, through the selection of themes and paths, laboratory teaching and practice, is declined in function of the interpretation of the heritage, the transfer of knowledge and the acquisition of specific operational skills by the graduates. The degree course includes a robust series of mandatory teachings, some optional ones and language (English language B2), specific computer laboratories, as well as a significant internship activity, in addition to the elective credits and the credits of the final exam, consisting in the the application of the knowledge and skills acquired to a significant case study. 12 credits are dedicated to laboratory courses in class-specific areas, essential for the strong declination of the course, half of which are held in English. Students will be given the opportunity to follow two other courses in a language other than Italian, to obtain a more marketable education in the European context and to be able to transmit the acquired disciplinary skills to a wider audience. Finally, integrative teaching activities are planned, namely seminars relating to the themes of heritage education and the pedagogy of cultural heritage, held by qualified experts. The teachings cover the areas of Ancient History and Archaeology, History of Art and Museology, History of Architecture, Restoration and Chemical-Physical Disciplines for Diagnostics and Restoration, Modern History and Archives, Economics and Legislation, in order to fully satisfy the requirements of both classes LM-2 and LM-89 and, above all, to guarantee a solid preparation in the class specific areas, which have also been drawn upon for related disciplines, and a wide versatility for post-graduate career opportunities: in fact, the aim is to leave graduates the possibility of opting, depending on the arising opportunities, also for other career paths allowed by the two classes, as archaeologists or specialist art historians, or to access the training for secondary teaching. In particular, the integration of the archaeological subjects (covering classical archaeology and art history, prehistory and landscape archaeology), historical subjects (antiquity and the modern age) including the archives field, historical-artistic subjects (relating to the Middle Ages and the modern age, museology as well as the history of architecture) and subjects related to diagnostics, restoration, legislation, economics, provide graduates with a complete training, whether they opt for the LM-2 class or the LM-89 class, to be able to find their way in the fields of conservation, museum management and enhancement, with reference to archaeological assets and contexts as well as assets and contexts of historical-artistic interest.\n"

        "answer": "Specific objectives:\nThe 2nd cycle  Degree in Statistics and Data Science, consistent with the requirements of the educational objectives of both classes and with the indications coming from the surveys on the employment market of graduates in statistical disciplines (such as, for example, the AlmaLaurea interuniversity initiative), aims at training graduates who, with a solid, high level, background in mathematics, probability, statistics and computer science, are able to operate in various application areas with autonomy and responsibility and to enter the labour market as qualified experts, able to produce, manage and analyse diversified information flows.\nIn particular, the CdS provides the tools to enable a solid statistical methodology and data interrogation and extraction preparation together with tools specific to some application contexts.\nThe frontal teaching activity is characterized by the strong integration between theoretical lessons and exercises and laboratories.\nThe educational structure of the Degree Course is characterized by: - the presence of a common package of advanced level teachings in mathematical, probabilistic, statistical and computer science disciplines capable of ensuring in-depth study and the acquisition of knowledge useful for subsequent methodological and applicative expansions of statistics; - a good degree of customization of the study programme by the student, to whom some customizations are recommended with reference to specific skills in some applied contexts; - attention to teaching methodologies, taking care that the solid theoretical training, based on frontal teachings, is integrated with application laboratories as much as possible in eco-digital environments in which real cases and problems will be discussed and topics of applicative relevance will be explored; - attention to the methods, tools and applications of innovative teaching (gamification, flipped classroom, etc.) and to service learning (with specific involvement of students).\nTwo curricula are also planned, taking into account the growing international demand for these specific training courses. In the proposed program, the teachings are almost entirely covered by full professors of the first and second level and, to ensure maximum adherence to the contents and training objectives, teachings are largely proposed ex novo for the new course of study, therefore with specific attention to contents designed for the specific professional profile. \nTwo curricula are foreseen. The first curriculum includes an initial core, in the first year, of advanced statistical and data science disciplines and responds to the need to maintain a chain that, based on the first level degree in statistics (L41) already active at the University for many years, develops in a coherent and specific way the skills most related to the theoretical and applied disciplinary and content tradition of statistics. \nThe curriculum emphasizes the role of statistics for complex data and for the extraction and management of big data with particular attention to the most advanced statistical modelling and with specific applications in the social and economic fields, this also thanks to a wide use of three optional groups (plus a group chosen by the student) of subjects able to guarantee sufficient thematic depth in relation to the student's interests. \nIn this sense, the first curriculum provides training oriented to the basics of stochastic processes and networks, with data mining techniques and support of advanced statistical methods and models in both the parametric and non-parametric context and with specific attention to Bayesian approaches, without neglecting data and database management, as well as the necessary legal skills on the protection, management and conservation of data, and specific application areas oriented to the company and the economic and social context of analysis. These aspects can be further specified, at the student's choice, through optional subjects (group 1 and group 2) enabling in-depth study of genetic statistics, methods of evaluation and performance of services, sampling and social surveys, financial risk analysis, territorial economic analysis, or even in terms of modelling such as biostatistics, models for categorical data, natural language processing and internet tools. The subjects are activated ex novo to ensure maximum correspondence with the training needs of the Degree Course and maximum coherence within the syllabus. Students can also add among the optional subjects (group 3) some subjects of the second curriculum and, in particular, techniques and methods on some analysis topics such as - for example - cloud computing, high dimensional data, models for volatility in finance, but subjects of a broader scope belonging to the mathematical, economic, business, sociological and computer science areas. As always, the additional group remains free to choose by the student. The second curriculum offers partially differentiated contents - also with dedicated optional subjects - to guarantee a study path in line with specific aspects of data analysis. Therefore, the second curriculum is more oriented towards the management of complex data, querying but also data structure design, placing emphasis on more computer-side and computation-intensive automatic methods also with respect to the management of high-frequency multidimensional data. Also in this curriculum, customization with optional subjects (and the group chosen by the student) enables some thematic insights, but here limited to two more specific groups with technical disciplines also aimed at completing, if necessary, the student's statistical-methodological skills. Therefore, this profile proposes, from the first year, an enhancement is that is more oriented towards statistical learning, data and text mining and advanced computation skills, without neglecting the application aspects in the economic and social fields, but now declined in terms of an approach with complex and more computer-intensive data such as modelling approaches in finance or optimization and applications in contexts of very high-frequency multidimensional data. The more strictly statistical methods are assigned to an optional group (group 1) with some specific contents exclusively for methodological in-depth study, while another optional group (group 2) provides teachings with high technical qualification such as financial econometrics, risk management, survey sampling methods, marketing decisions and advanced mathematical and computer science subjects, such as cybersecurity and the Internet of Things. Once again, the additional group (group 4) with free choice by the student allows the free addition of subjects or other training activities. Finally, the delivery in English of this second curriculum appears useful to encourage qualified international demand and to complete a broad training offer also to the advantage of local students who will have additional training opportunities on site.\nThe two curricula include a basic internship that can also be extended through the free choices of the students who, therefore, can achieve a wide coverage of credits for internships, guaranteeing maximum flexibility also based on specific needs expressed by the student or the host company.\nBoth curricula provide for an equal distribution of credits among the 4 semesters of the two years with a greater concentration of training activities in the first 3 semesters, and the last semester mostly dedicated to internships, placement and consultancy activities, as well as to elective activities .\n"

        "answer": "Specific objectives:\nWithin an integrated path of historical-archaeological and historical-artistic cut, the Degree Course aims in particular at satisfying the need for functional professionalism in heritage education, in addition to the traditional areas of conservation, management and enhancement of cultural heritage, in the spirit of the so-called \"Faro Convention\", ratified by 20 member countries of the Council of Europe, including Italy, which has expressly brought the conscious enjoyment and sharing of cultural heritage back into the fold of the fundamental rights of the individual.\nThe objective is to further define and qualify the profiles of museum educator and operator of educational services of cultural sites, as well as of the teaching staff and future schoolteachers of historical-artistic and humanistic disciplines with targeted training, enhancing the indispensable advanced skills on archaeological and historical-artistic assets at the centre of heritage education actions.\nOn the basis of these assumptions, the training project focuses on the specific subjects common to the two classes LM-2 and LM-89, with  some class-specific sectors of one class and related sectors of the other (or vice versa) providing the necessary completion of knowledge on the historical-cultural contexts, on the sources and on the technical and conservative, regulatory and financial aspects, ensuring a robust training in archaeological and artistic heritage disciplines which is essential for the quality and effectiveness of the graduates' activity; to this end, the aforementioned disciplinary training, through the selection of themes and paths, laboratory teaching and practice, is declined in function of the interpretation of the heritage, the transfer of knowledge and the acquisition of specific operational skills by the graduates. The degree course includes a robust series of mandatory teachings, some optional ones and language (English language B2), specific computer laboratories, as well as a significant internship activity, in addition to the elective credits and the credits of the final exam, consisting in the the application of the knowledge and skills acquired to a significant case study. 12 credits are dedicated to laboratory courses in class-specific areas, essential for the strong declination of the course, half of which are held in English. Students will be given the opportunity to follow two other courses in a language other than Italian, to obtain a more marketable education in the European context and to be able to transmit the acquired disciplinary skills to a wider audience. Finally, integrative teaching activities are planned, namely seminars relating to the themes of heritage education and the pedagogy of cultural heritage, held by qualified experts. The teachings cover the areas of Ancient History and Archaeology, History of Art and Museology, History of Architecture, Restoration and Chemical-Physical Disciplines for Diagnostics and Restoration, Modern History and Archives, Economics and Legislation, in order to fully satisfy the requirements of both classes LM-2 and LM-89 and, above all, to guarantee a solid preparation in the class specific areas, which have also been drawn upon for related disciplines, and a wide versatility for post-graduate career opportunities: in fact, the aim is to leave graduates the possibility of opting, depending on the arising opportunities, also for other career paths allowed by the two classes, as archaeologists or specialist art historians, or to access the training for secondary teaching. In particular, the integration of the archaeological subjects (covering classical archaeology and art history, prehistory and landscape archaeology), historical subjects (antiquity and the modern age) including the archives field, historical-artistic subjects (relating to the Middle Ages and the modern age, museology as well as the history of architecture) and subjects related to diagnostics, restoration, legislation, economics, provide graduates with a complete training, whether they opt for the LM-2 class or the LM-89 class, to be able to find their way in the fields of conservation, museum management and enhancement, with reference to archaeological assets and contexts as well as assets and contexts of historical-artistic interest.\n"

They combine the technical skills related to the production and consumption of food and wine, to their marketing and to their media repercussions, with the notions and sensibilities of socio-semiotics, cultural geography, aesthetics enabling them to give back to the food phenomenon the cultural and symbolic depth characterising it, being able therefore to operate with awareness and effectiveness, in the promotion of food and wine products in different socio-cultural contexts as well as in food education or in the production of different text types, from food and wine journalism to guides, from social media to television broadcasts, etc.\nThe educational programme is divided into different areas of knowledge:\n- Semiotic-communicative area, with teachings such as Food and Wine Languages and Food Experience, Media and food and wine, Brand Semiotics, Design and food packaging, Semiotics of consumption spaces, Theory and techniques of seriality.\n- Historical, anthropological, geographical, and social area, with the teachings: Ethnogastronomy, History of Food, Food Consumption Sociology.\n- Area of Food Sciences and Nutrition, with the teachings: Mediterranean Food Systems and Supply Chains, Nutrition and Health, Sensory Analysis and Wine Production.\n- Legal area, with the teaching: Agri-Food Law.\n- Economic-Tourism and Marketing area, with teaching such as Food and Wine Marketing and Tourism, Cultural and Food and Wine Heritage Management.\n- Creativity and design area, with the teachings: Communication Campaign Workshop, Exhibit Design Workshop, Food Writing Workshop.\nDuring the first course year, students acquire the skills necessary to understand the communicative and cultural aspects characterizing food and wine systems, the history of food and the social dimension associated with food consumption. The basis for understanding the mechanisms of taste experience is also provided. Furthermore, through the laboratories, students will acquire practical skills related to the creation of communication campaigns, to the writing of different text types, and to the design of consumption spaces. An elective course will enable them to decide to personalise their own path, deepening different aspects of the food phenomenon, from the more technical ones such as the nutritional aspects or the production dynamics in the wine sector, to the more communicative ones related to the construction and management of the brand, to the packaging design, to the analysis of the consumption spaces, up to the legal or managerial aspects.\nIn the second year, skills and tools will be provided to analyse the media impact of food and wine, the aesthetic peculiarities of food taste as well as tasting techniques. These skills will be complemented by those related to food and wine marketing and to the tourism dynamics caused by food and wine, as well as to the production aspects and the link they have with quality certifications and therefore with their economic repercussions. Through the elective activities students will be able to complete their own path in the direction they wish. Finally, through the internship, students will be able to put into practice what they have learned and eventually develop specific thesis projects together with companies.\nThe credits in subjects useful for entering the job market will be provided through a program of seminars with companies and professionals operating in various fields: from catering to journalism, from education to marketing.\n"
